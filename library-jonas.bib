Probabilistic forecasting aims to maximize the sharpness of the predictive distributions, subject to calibration, on the basis of the available information set. We formalize and study notions of calibration in a prediction space setting. In practice, probabilistic calibration can be checked by examining probability integral transform (PIT) histograms. Proper scoring rules such as the logarithmic score and the continuous ranked probability score serve to assess calibration and sharpness simultaneously. As a special case, consistent scoring functions provide decision-theoretically coherent tools for evaluating point forecasts. We emphasize methodological links to parametric and nonparametric distributional regression techniques, which attempt to model and to estimate conditional distribution functions; we use the context of statistically postprocessed ensemble forecasts in numerical weather prediction as an example. Throughout, we illustrate concepts and methodologies in data examples.},

The resource has 3 interdependent components. PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. PhysioNet is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software via the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet.org), PhysioNet offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels of expertise.},

  abstract = {Summary               The bootstrap is a method for estimating the distribution of an estimator or test statistic by resampling one's data or a model estimated from the data. The methods that are available for implementing the bootstrap and the accuracy of bootstrap estimates depend on whether the data are an independent random sample or a time series. This paper is concerned with the application of the bootstrap to time‐series data when one does not have a finite‐dimensional parametric model that reduces the data generation process to independent random sampling. We review the methods that have been proposed for implementing the bootstrap in this situation and discuss the accuracy of these methods relative to that of first‐order asymptotic approximations. We argue that methods for implementing the bootstrap with time‐series data are not as well understood as methods for data that are independent random samples. Although promising bootstrap methods for time series are available, there is a considerable need for further research in the application of the bootstrap to time series. We describe some of the important unsolved problems.                                         Résumé               Le bootstrap est une méthode pour estimer la distribution d'un estimateur en rééchantillonnant ses données ou un modéle estiméà partir des données. Les méthodes disponibles pour mettre en oeuvre le bootstrap et la précision des estimateurs de bootstrap dépendent de ce que les données proviennent d'un échantillon aléatoire indépendant ou d'une série temporelle. Cet article concerne l'application du bootstrap aux données des séries temporelles quand on ne dispose pas de modéle paramétrique de dimension finie qui réduise le processus de génération des données à l'échantillonnage aléatoire indépendent. Nous examinons les méthodes qui ont été proposées pour mettre en oeuvre le bootstrap dans cette situation et discutons la precision de ces méthodes comparativement à celle des approximations asymptotiques de premier ordre. Nous montrons que les méthodes pour mettre en oeuvre le bootstrap avec les données des séries temporelles ne sont pas aussi bien comprises que les méthodes pour les données des échantillons aléatoires indépendants. Bien que des méthodes de bootstrap prometteuses pour les séries temporelles soient disponibles, il y a un besoin considérable de recherche supplémental re dans leur application. Nous décrivons quelques problémes importants non résolus.},

The bootstrap provides statistical inferences—standard error and bias estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests—without assumptions such as Normal distributions or equal variances. As such, bootstrap methods can be remarkably more accurate than classical inferences based on Normal or               t               distributions. The bootstrap uses the same basic procedure regardless of the statistic being calculated, without requiring the use of application‐specific formulae. This article may provide two big surprises for many readers. The first is that the bootstrap shows that common               t               confidence intervals are woefully inaccurate when populations are skewed, with one‐sided coverage levels off by factors of two or more, even for very large samples. The second is that the number of bootstrap samples required is much larger than generally realized.

This was motivated by an example in which some standard evaluation procedures using probability integral transforms cannot distinguish the ideal forecast from several competing forecasts. We show that this example has some unrealistic features from a time series forecasting perspective, and so provides insecure foundations for the argument that existing calibration procedures are inadequate in practice. Our alternative, more realistic example shows how relevant statistical methods, including information-based methods, provide the required discrimination between competing forecasts. We introduce a new test of density forecast efficiency. © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, any non-trivial weighted average of two or more distinct, calibrated probability forecasts is necessarily uncalibrated and lacks sharpness. In view of this, linear pooling requires recalibration, even in the ideal case in which the individual forecasts are calibrated. Towards this end, we propose a beta-transformed linear opinion pool for the aggregation of probability forecasts from distinct, calibrated or uncalibrated sources. The method fits an optimal non-linearly recalibrated forecast combination, by compositing a beta transform and the traditional linear opinion pool. The technique is illustrated in a simulation example and in a case-study on statistical and National Weather Service probability of precipitation forecasts. © 2010 Royal Statistical Society.},

  abstract = {Real-time surveillance is a crucial element in the response to infectious disease outbreaks. However, the interpretation of incidence data is often hampered by delays occurring at various stages of data gathering and reporting. As a result, recent values are biased downward, which obscures current trends. Statistical nowcasting techniques can be employed to correct these biases, allowing for accurate characterization of recent developments and thus enhancing situational awareness. In this paper, we present a preregistered real-time assessment of eight nowcasting approaches, applied by independent research teams to German 7-day hospitalization incidences during the COVID-19 pandemic. This indicator played an important role in the management of the outbreak in Germany and was linked to levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions via certain thresholds. Due to its definition, in which hospitalization counts are aggregated by the date of case report rather than admission, German hospitalization incidences are particularly affected by delays and can take several weeks or months to fully stabilize. For this study, all methods were applied from 22 November 2021 to 29 April 2022, with probabilistic nowcasts produced each day for the current and 28 preceding days. Nowcasts at the national, state, and age-group levels were collected in the form of quantiles in a public repository and displayed in a dashboard. Moreover, a mean and a median ensemble nowcast were generated. We find that overall, the compared methods were able to remove a large part of the biases introduced by delays. Most participating teams underestimated the importance of very long delays, though, resulting in nowcasts with a slight downward bias. The accompanying prediction intervals were also too narrow for almost all methods. Averaged over all nowcast horizons, the best performance was achieved by a model using case incidences as a covariate and taking into account longer delays than the other approaches. For the most recent days, which are often considered the most relevant in practice, a mean ensemble of the submitted nowcasts performed best. We conclude by providing some lessons learned on the definition of nowcasting targets and practical challenges.},
