  abstract = {The multisensor precipitation estimates (MPE) data, available in hourly temporal and 4 km × 4 km spatial resolution, are produced by the National Weather Service and mosaicked as a national product known as Stage IV. The MPE products have a significant advantage over rain gauge measurements due to their ability to capture spatial variability of rainfall. However, the advantages are limited by complications related to the indirect nature of remotely sensed precipitation estimates. Previous studies confirm that efforts are required to determine the accuracy of MPE and their associated uncertainties for future use in hydrological and climate studies. So far, various approaches and extensive research have been undertaken to develop an uncertainty model. In this paper, an ensemble generator is presented for MPE products that can be used to evaluate the uncertainty of rainfall estimates. Two different elliptical copula families, namely, Gaussian and t-copula are used for simulations. The results indicate that using t-copula may have significant advantages over the well-known Gaussian copula particularly with respect to extremes. Overall, the model in which t-copula was used for simulation successfully generated rainfall ensembles with similar characteristics to those of the ground reference measurements. © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {A number of realizations of one or more numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, initialised at a variety of initial conditions, compose an ensemble forecast. These forecasts exhibit systematic errors and biases that can be corrected by statistical post-processing. Post-processing yields calibrated forecasts by analysing the statistical relationship between historical forecasts and their corresponding observations. This article aims to extend post-processing methodology to incorporate atmospheric circulation. The circulation, or flow, is largely responsible for the weather that we experience and it is hypothesized here that relationships between the NWP model and the atmosphere depend upon the prevailing flow. Numerous studies have focussed on the tendency of this flow to reduce to a set of recognisable arrangements, known as regimes, which recur and persist at fixed geographical locations. This dynamical phenomenon allows the circulation to be categorized into a small number of regime states. In a highly idealized model of the atmosphere, the Lorenz ‘96 system, ensemble forecasts are subjected to well-known post-processing techniques conditional on the system's underlying regime. Two different variables, one of the state variables and one related to the energy of the system, are forecasted and considerable improvements in forecast skill upon standard post-processing are seen when the distribution of the predictand varies depending on the regime. Advantages of this approach and its inherent challenges are discussed, along with potential extensions for operational forecasters.},

  abstract = {The binned probability ensemble (BPE) technique is presented as a method for producing forecasts of the probability distribution of a variable using an ensemble of numerical model integrations. The ensemble forecasts are used to partition the real line into a number of bins, each of which has an equal probability of containing the "true" forecast. The method is tested for both a simple low-order dynamical system and a general circulation model (GCM) forced with observed sea surface temperatures (an ensemble of Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project integrations). The BPE method can also be used to calculate the probability that probabilistic ensemble forecasts are consistent with the verifying observations. The method is not sensitive to the fact that the characteristics of the forecast probability distribution may change drastically for different initial condition (or boundary condition) probability distributions. For example, the method is capable of evaluating whether the variance of a set of ensemble forecasts is consistent with the verifying observed variance. Applying the method to the ensemble of boundary-forced GCM integrations demonstrates that the GCM produces probabilistic forecasts with too little variability for upper-level dynamical fields. Operational weather prediction centers including the U. K. Meteorological Office, the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts, and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction have been applying this method, referred to by them as Talagrand diagrams, to the verification of operational ensemble predictions. The BPE method only evaluates the consistency of ensemble predictions and observations and should be used in conjunction with additional verification tools to provide a complete assessment of a set of probabilistic forecasts.},

Even though the true density is unknown, using the LR statistic amounts to comparing models with the KLIC as a loss function and thus enables us to assess which density forecast model can approximate the true density more closely. We also discuss how this KLIC is related to the KLIC based on the probability integral transform (PIT) in the framework of Diebold et al. (1998). While they are asymptotically equivalent, the PIT-based KLIC is best suited for evaluating the adequacy of each density forecast model and the original KLIC is best suited for comparing competing models. In an empirical study with the S\&P500 and NASDAQ daily return series, we find strong evidence for rejecting the normal-GARCH benchmark model, in favor of the models that can capture skewness in the conditional distribution and asymmetry and long memory in the conditional variance.

  abstract = {Wind direction is an angular variable, as opposed to weather quantities such as temperature, quantitative precipitation, or wind speed, which are linear variables. Consequently, traditional model output statistics and ensemble postprocessing methods become ineffective, or do not apply at all. This paper proposes an effective bias correction technique for wind direction forecasts from numerical weather prediction models, which is based on a state-of-the-art circular-circular regression approach. To calibrate forecast ensembles, a Bayesian model averaging scheme for directional variables is introduced, where the component distributions are von Mises densities centered at the individually bias-corrected ensemble member forecasts. These techniques are applied to 48-h forecasts of surface wind direction over the Pacific Northwest, using the University of Washington mesoscale ensemble, where they yield consistent improvements in forecast performance. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.}

A standard approach is the ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) method, a distributional regression approach where the forecast distribution is given by a single parametric law with parameters depending on the ensemble members. Choosing an appropriate parametric family for the weather variable of interest is a critical, however, often non-trivial task, and has been the focus of much recent research. In this article, we assess the merits of combining predictive distributions from multiple EMOS models based on different parametric families. In four case studies with wind speed and precipitation forecasts from two ensemble prediction systems, we study whether state of the art forecast combination methods are able to improve forecast skill.},

  abstract = {Ensemble weather forecasts often under-represent uncertainty, leading to overconfidence in their predictions. Multi-model forecasts combining several individual ensembles have been shown to display greater skill than single-ensemble forecasts in predicting temperatures, but tend to retain some bias in their joint predictions. Established postprocessing techniques are able to correct bias and calibration issues in univariate forecasts, but are generally not designed to handle multivariate forecasts (of several variables or at several locations, say). We propose a flexible multivariate Bayesian postprocessing framework, based on a directed acyclic graph representing the relationships between the ensembles and the observed weather. The posterior forecast is inferred from available ensemble forecasts and an estimate of the shared discrepancy, obtained from a collection of past forecast–observation pairs. We also propose a novel approach to selecting an appropriate training set for estimation of the required correction, using synoptic-scale analogues to obtain a regime-dependent estimate of the adjustment. The proposed technique is applied to forecasts of surface temperature over the UK during the winter period from 2007 to 2013. Although the resulting parametric multivariate-normal probabilistic forecasts are marginally less sharp than those of the leading competitor, they capture the spatial structure of the observations better than a correlation structure based on either the ensembles or climatology alone, and are robust to changes in the variables and spatial domain of the forecast, at a greatly reduced computational cost.},

Building on the work of Ranjan and Gneiting, we use infinite beta mixtures for the calibration. The proposed Bayesian nonparametric approach takes advantage of the flexibility of Dirichlet process mixtures to achieve any continuous deformation of linearly combined predictive distributions. The inference procedure is based on combination Gibbs and slice sampling. We provide some conditions under which the proposed probabilistic calibration converges in terms of weak posterior consistency to the true underlying density for both cases of iid and Markovian observations. This calibration property improves upon the earlier calibration approaches. We study the methodology in simulation examples with fat tails and multimodal densities and apply it to density forecasts of daily S\&P returns and daily maximum wind speed at the Frankfurt airport.

In the present paper, we establish weak convergence of the empirical copula process (for observations that are allowed to be serially dependent) with respect to weighted supremum distances. The usefulness of our results is illustrated by applications to general bivariate rank statistics and to estimation procedures for the Pickands dependence function arising in multivariate extreme-value theory.},

However, in the context of many models of financial risk, interest centers on more than just a single point of the forecast distribution. For example, value-at-risk models that are currently in extremely wide use form interval forecasts. Many other important financial calculations also involve estimates not summarized by a point forecast. Although some techniques are currently available for assessing interval and density forecasts, existing methods tend to display low power in sample sizes typically available. This article suggests a new approach to evaluating such forecasts. It requires evaluation of the entire forecast distribution, rather than a scalar or interval. The information content of forecast distributions combined with ex post realizations is enough to construct a powerful test even with sample sizes as small as 100.},

  abstract = {Forecast ensembles typically show a spread-skill relationship, but they are also often underdispersive, and therefore uncalibrated. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is a statistical postprocessing method for forecast ensembles that generates calibrated probabilistic forecast products for weather quantities at individual sites. This paper introduces the spatial BMA technique, which combines BMA and the geostatistical output perturbation (GOP) method, and extends BMA to generate calibrated probabilistic forecasts of whole weather fields simultaneously, rather than just weather events at individual locations. At any site individually, spatial BMA reduces to the original BMA technique. The spatial BMA method provides statistical ensembles of weather field forecasts that take the spatial structure of observed fields into account and honor the flow-dependent information contained in the dynamical ensemble. The members of the spatial BMA ensemble are obtained by dressing the weather field forecasts from the dynamical ensemble with simulated spatially correlated error fields, in proportions that correspond to the BMA weights for the member models in the dynamical ensemble. Statistical ensembles of any size can be generated at minimal computational cost. The spatial BMA technique was applied to 48-h forecasts of surface temperature over the Pacific Northwest in 2004, using the University of Washington mesoscale ensemble. The spatial BMA ensemble generally outperformed the BMA and GOP ensembles and showed much better verification results than the raw ensemble, both at individual sites, for weather field forecasts, and for forecasts of composite quantities, such as average temperature in National Weather Service forecast zones and minimum temperature along the Interstate 90 Mountains to Sound Greenway. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

However, Leonard Savage--the inventor of Bayesian decision theory--argued that it would be ridiculous to use his theory outside the kind of small world in which it is always possible to "look before you leap." If taken seriously, this view makes Bayesian decision theory inappropriate for the large worlds of scientific discovery and macroeconomic enterprise. When is it correct to use Bayesian decision theory--and when does it need to be modified? Using a minimum of mathematics, Rational Decisions clearly explains the foundations of Bayesian decision theory and shows why Savage restricted the theory's application to small worlds. The book is a wide-ranging exploration of standard theories of choice and belief under risk and uncertainty. Ken Binmore discusses the various philosophical attitudes related to the nature of probability and offers resolutions to paradoxes believed to hinder further progress. In arguing that the Bayesian approach to knowledge is inadequate in a large world, Binmore proposes an extension to Bayesian decision theory--allowing the idea of a mixed strategy in game theory to be expanded to a larger set of what Binmore refers to as "muddled" strategies. Written by one of the world's leading game theorists, Rational Decisions is the touchstone for anyone needing a concise, accessible, and expert view on Bayesian decision making.},

Together with developments in computer technology this has stimulated the design and operation of a variety of systems to exploit these data in weather forecasting. Growing awareness of the importance of detailed site specific weather information and forecasts from zero to a few hours ahead has led to the emergence of a particular kind of forecasting called nowcasting which depends on the exceptionally detailed knowledge of the current pattern of weather that remote sensing can provide. This type of weather forecasting is reviewed, with emphasis on the measurement and extrapolation up to about 2 hours ahead of fields of various weather parameters, especially rainfall. Trends in the design of nowcasting systems are discussed, and potential benefits summarized.},

Accurate estimates of age are needed both for identifying real age in individuals without any identity document and assessing it for human remains. The methods applied in such context are mostly based on radiological analysis of some anatomical districts and entail the use of a regression model. However, estimating chronological age by regression models leads to overestimated ages in younger subjects and underestimated ages in older ones. We introduced a full Bayesian calibration method combined with a segmented function for age estimation that relied on a Normal distribution as a density model to mitigate this bias. In this way, we were also able to model the decreasing growth rate in juveniles. We compared our new Bayesian-segmented model with other existing approaches. The proposed method helped producing more robust and precise forecasts of age than compared models while exhibited comparable accuracy in terms of forecasting measures. Our method seemed to overcome the estimation bias also when applied to a real data set of South-African juvenile subjects.},

The decomposition is applied to the results of the Ensemble Prediction Systems of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction.

The possibility of determining an accurate reliability-resolution decomposition of the RPSs is severely limited by the unavoidably (relatively) small number of available realizations of the prediction system.

Combining more opinions and calibrating them to maximize the forecast accuracy is consequently a crucial issue in several economic problems. This paper applies a Bayesian beta mixture model to derive a combined and calibrated density function using random calibration functionals and random combination weights. In particular, it compares the application of linear, harmonic and logarithmic pooling in the Bayesian combination approach. The three combination schemes, i.e., linear, harmonic and logarithmic, are studied in simulation examples with multimodal densities and an empirical application with a large database of stock data. All of the experiments show that in a beta mixture calibration framework, the three combination schemes are substantially equivalent, achieving calibration, and no clear preference for one of them appears. The financial application shows that the linear pooling together with beta mixture calibration achieves the best results in terms of calibrated forecast.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS               Nineteen adults with type 1 diabetes wore four Dexcom SEVEN PLUS subcutaneous glucose sensors during two 9-h studies. One pair of sensors was worn on each side of the abdomen, with each sensor pair placed at a predetermined distance apart and 20 cm away from the opposite pair. Arterialized venous blood glucose levels were measured every 15 min, and sensor glucose values were recorded every 5 min. Sensors were calibrated once at the beginning of the study.                                         RESULTS               The use of four sensors significantly reduced very large errors compared with one sensor (0.4 vs. 2.6\% of errors ≥50\% from reference glucose, P \&lt; 0.001) and also improved overall accuracy (mean absolute relative difference, 11.6 vs. 14.8\%, P \&lt; 0.001). Using only two sensors also significantly improved very large errors and accuracy. Intersensor distance did not affect the function of sensor pairs.                                         CONCLUSIONS               Sensor accuracy is significantly improved with the use of multiple sensors compared with the use of a single sensor. The benefit of redundancy is present even when sensors are positioned very closely together (7 mm). These findings are relevant to the design of an artificial pancreas device.},

A joint distribution in this class is characterized by a parametric copula function evaluated at nonparametric marginal distributions. This class of distributions has gained popularity in diverse fields due to its flexibility in separately modeling the dependence structure and the marginal behaviors of a multivariate random variable, and its circumvention of the "curse of dimensionality" associated with purely nonparametric multivariate distributions. We show that the plug-in sieve maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of all smooth functional, including the finite-dimensional copula parameters and the unknown marginal distributions, are semiparamctrically efficient, and that their asymptotic variances can be estimated consistently. Moreover, prior restrictions on the marginal distributions can be easily incorporated into the sieve maximum likelihood estimation procedure to achieve further efficiency gains. Two such cases are studied: (a) the marginal distributions are equal but otherwise unspecified, and (b) some but not all marginal distributions are parametric. Monte Carlo studies indicate that the sieve MLEs perform well in finite samples, especially when prior information on the marginal distributions is incorporated. © 2006 American Statistical Association.},

Unlike marginal and joint distributions, which are directly observable, the copula of a random vector is a hidden dependence structure that links the joint distribution with its margins. Choosing a parametric copula model is thus a nontrivial task but it can be facilitated by relying on a nonparametric estimator. Here the authors propose a kernel estimator of the copula that is mean square consistent everywhere on the support. They determine the bias and variance of this estimator. They also study the effects of kernel smoothing on copula estimation. They then propose a smoothing bandwidth selection rule based on the derived bias and variance. After confirming their theoretical findings through simulations, they use their kernel estimator to formulate a goodness-of-fit test for parametric copula models.},

It will then introduce new techniques to design Markov processes that are suited to represent the dynamics of market risk factors and their co-movement, providing techniques to both estimate and simulate such dynamics. The second part of the book will show readers how to apply these methods to the evaluation of pricing of multivariate derivative contracts in the equity and credit markets.

In this paper, three univariate ARMA-based models are applied to tourism demand, as represented by the number of world-wide visitors to Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. The study employs both monthly and quarterly time series generated from nine principal tourist destinations in Asian-Pacific region in the forecasting exercise to ensure the reliability of the forecasting evaluation. Forecasting performance based on disaggregated arrival series in a particular destination is examined as well. The general impression is that the ARMA-based models perform very well and in some cases the magnitude of mean absolute percentage error is lower than 2\% level. © 2008.},

While remote sensing data have been used in urban modeling and analysis for some time, the proposed combination of remote sensing and spatial metrics for that purpose is quite novel. Starting with a review of recent developments in each of these fields, we show how the systematic, combined use of these tools can contribute an important new level of information to urban modeling and urban analysis in general. We claim that the proposed approach leads to an improved understanding and representation of urban dynamics and helps to develop alternative conceptions of urban spatial structure and change. The theoretical argument is then illustrated with actual examples from the urban area of Santa Barbara, California. Some questions for future research are finally put forward to help strengthen the potential of the proposed framework, especially regarding the further exploration of urban dynamics at different geographic scales. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Experts often provide valuable information regarding important uncertainties in decision and risk analyses because of the limited availability of hard data to use in those analyses. Multiple experts are often consulted in order to obtain as much information as possible, leading to the problem of how to combine or aggregate their information. Information may also be obtained from other sources such as forecasting techniques or scientific models. Because uncertainties are typically represented in terms of probability distributions, we consider expert and other information in terms of probability distributions. We discuss a variety of models that lead to specific combination methods. The output of these methods is a combined probability distribution, which can be viewed as representing a summary of the current state of information regarding the uncertainty of interest. After presenting the models and methods, we discuss empirical evidence on the performance of the methods. In the conclusion, we highlight important conceptual and practical issues to be considered when designing a combination process for use in practice.},

Therefore, we focus on two recently developed approaches to estimate confidence regions for level sets and extend them to provide confidence regions for multivariate quantiles based on copulas. In a simulation study, we check coverage probabilities of the employed approaches. In particular, we focus on small sample sizes. One approach shows reasonable coverage probabilities and the second one obtains mixed results. Not only the bounded copula domain but also the additional estimation of the quantile level pose some problems. A small sample application gives further insight into the employed techniques.},

  abstract = {Summary             The emission requirements for jet engines are becoming more stringent and the combustion process determines pollutant emissions. Therefore, we model the distribution of fuel drops generated by a fuel injector in a jet engine, which can be assumed to be a five-dimensional problem in terms of drop size, x-position, y-position, x-velocity and y-velocity. The data are generated by numerical simulations of the fuel atomization process for several jet engine operating conditions. In combustion simulations, the variables are usually assumed to be independent at the start of the simulation, which is clearly not so as our data show. The dependence between some of the variables is non-monotone and asymmetric, which makes the modelling task difficult. Our aim is to provide a realistic parametric model for the dependence structure. For this, we employ vine copulas which provide a flexible way to construct a multivariate distribution function. However, we need to use non-standard bivariate copulas as building blocks. Using this copula representation enables us to create realistic samples of fuel spray droplets which improve the prediction of the combustion process and the pollutant emissions. Moreover, this approach is significantly faster than solving the set of differential equations describing fuel disintegration.},

  abstract = {With the availability of massive multivariate data comes a need to develop flexible multivariate distribution classes. The copula approach allows marginal models to be constructed for each variable separately and joined with a dependence structure characterized by a copula. The class of multivariate copulas was limited for a long time to elliptical (including the Gaussian and t-copula) and Archimedean families (such as Clayton and Gumbel copulas). Both classes are rather restrictive with regard to symmetry and tail dependence properties. The class of vine copulas overcomes these limitations by building a multivariate model using only bivariate building blocks. This gives rise to highly flexible models that still allow for computationally tractable estimation and model selection procedures. These features made vine copula models quite popular among applied researchers in numerous areas of science. This article reviews the basic ideas underlying these models, presents estimation and model selection approaches, and discusses current developments and future directions.},

The modeled error time series preserve the characteristics of the historical forecast data sets. Four statistical characteristics are considered: the means, the standard deviations, the autocorrelations and the cross-correlations. A stochastic optimization routine was used to find an optimal set of parameters that minimize the differences of the four characteristics between the generated error series and the targeted ones. The obtained parameters were then in due order of succession used to produce the RT, HA and DA forecasts. This method, although implemented as a first-order regressive random forecast error generator, can be extended to higher orders. Simulation results have shown that the methodology produces random forecast error series that have statistics similar to those derived from real data sets. The wind and load forecast error generator can be used in wind integration studies to produce wind and load forecast in time series for stochastic planning processes. Our future studies will focus on reflecting the diurnal and seasonal differences of the wind and load statistics and on implementing them in the random forecast generator. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We show, however, that deep networks learned by the standard gradient descent algorithm are in fact mathematically approximately equivalent to kernel machines, a learning method that simply memorizes the data and uses it directly for prediction via a similarity function (the kernel). This greatly enhances the interpretability of deep network weights, by elucidating that they are effectively a superposition of the training examples. The network architecture incorporates knowledge of the target function into the kernel. This improved understanding should lead to better learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {Distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV), are likely to comprise a substantial fraction of new generation capacity in the United States. However, forecasting technology adoption based on people's willingness to pay (WTP) faces two major challenges: the stated-intention and omitted-variable biases. Previous solar adoption literature has neglected to address these two biases altogether. Here, we adopt a “parameterization + calibration” approach to address both biases and estimate customers’ WTP for PV. After collecting survey data on respondents’ WTP for adopting PV, we characterize its empirical cumulative density function using a gamma distribution. We further calibrate the gamma distribution parameters using a national distributed PV adoption simulation model, finding the parameters that produce the best fit between simulated and historic solar adoption. We then show that the calibrated gamma distribution improves the raw WTP data after correcting for the two biases. Finally, we use our optimally-calibrated WTP to forecast market demand for residential PV at the county-level of the United States in 2020. Improving estimates of customer willingness to pay has significant implications for policy directly, e.g. estimating the effect of a proposed policy on technology adoption, and other regulatory processes that use forecasting, e.g. integrated resource planning.},

Throughout the book, historical remarks and further readings highlight active research in the field, including new results, streamlined presentations, and new proofs of old results. After covering the essentials of copula theory, the book addresses the issue of modeling dependence among components of a random vector using copulas. It then presents copulas from the point of view of measure theory, compares methods for the approximation of copulas, and discusses the Markov product for 2-copulas. The authors also examine selected families of copulas that possess appealing features from both theoretical and applied viewpoints. The book concludes with in-depth discussions on two generalizations of copulas: quasi- and semi-copulas. Although copulas are not the solution to all stochastic problems, they are an indispensable tool for understanding several problems about stochastic dependence. This book gives you the solid and formal mathematical background to apply copulas to a range of mathematical areas, such as probability, real analysis, measure theory, and algebraic structures.},

Under this loss function empirical studies have generally found that equally-weighted combined forecasts lead to better performance than estimates of optimal forecast combination weights which in turn outperform the best individual predictions. We show that this and other results can be overturned when asymmetries are introduced in the loss function and the forecast error distribution is skewed. We characterize the optimal combination weights for the most commonly used alternatives to mean squared error loss and demonstrate how the degree of asymmetry in the loss function and skews in the underlying forecast error distribution can significantly change the optimal combination weights. We also propose estimation methods and investigate their small sample properties in simulations and in an inflation forecasting exercise. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Explanations of why averaging might in practice work better than constructing the optimal combination have centered on estimation error and the e¤ects variations of the data generating process have on this error. The ‡ip side of this explanation is that the size of the gains must be small enough to be outweighed by the estimation error. This paper examines the sizes of the theoretical gains to optimal combination, providing bounds for the gains for restricted parameter spaces and also conditions under which averaging and optimal combination are equivalent. The paper also suggests a new method for selecting between models that appears to work well with SPF data.},

Semantic analysis is applied to study the sentiment, emotionality and complexity of the language used. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variable (ARIMAX) models are used to make predictions and to confirm the value of the study variables. Results show that the combined analysis of the four media platforms carries valuable information in making financial forecasting. Twitter language complexity, GDELT number of articles and Wikipedia page reads have the highest predictive power. This study also allows a comparison of the different fore-sighting abilities of each platform, in terms of how many days ahead a platform can predict a price movement before it happens. In comparison with previous work, more media sources and more dimensions of the interaction and of the language used are combined in a joint analysis.},

All quantitative models are based on assumptions vis-a-vis the markets on which they are to be applied. Standard hedging techniques require a high level of liquidity of the underlying instruments; prices quoted for many financial products are often based on “normal” conditions. The latter may be interpreted in a more economic sense, or more specifically referring to the distributional (i.e., normal, Gaussian) behavior of some underlying data. One of the main aims of this chapter is to present effective algorithms for random variate generation from the various copula families studied. The properties of the specific copula family are often essential for the efficiency of the corresponding algorithm. The chapter also provides a general algorithm for random variate generation from copulas.},

Many dependency measures have been proposed according to concepts such as concordance, quadrant dependency, etc. More recently, the development of the Theory of Copulas has had a great impact in the study of dependence of random variables specially in the case of continuous random variables. In the case of the multivariate setting, the study of the strong mixing conditions has lead to interesting results that extend some results like the central limit theorem to the case of dependent random variables.In this paper, we study the behavior of a multidimensional extension of two well-known dependency measures, finding their basic properties as well as several examples. The main difference between these measures and others previously proposed is that these ones are based on the definition of independence among n random elements or variables, therefore they provide a nice way to measure dependency. The main purpose of this paper is to present a sample version of one of these measures, find its properties, and based on this sample version to propose a test of independence of multivariate observations. We include several references of applications in Statistics. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A copula is a function that links univariate marginals to their full multivariate distribution. Copulas were introduced in 1959 in the context of probabilistic metric spaces. The literature on the statistical properties and applications of copulas has been developing rapidly in recent years. This article explores some of these practical applications, including estimation of joint life mortality and multidecrement models. In addition, we describe basic properties of copulas, their relationships to measures of dependence, and several families of copulas that have appeared in the literature. An annotated bibliography provides a resource for researchers and practitioners who wish to continue their study of copulas. For those who wish to use copulas for statistical inference, we illustrate statistical inference procedures by using insurance company data on losses and expenses. For these data, we (1) show how to fit copulas and (2) describe their usefulness by pricing a reinsurance contract and estimating expenses for pre-specified losses. © 1998 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {Tail dependence refers to clustering of extreme events. In the context of financial risk management, the clustering of high-severity risks has a devastating effect on the well-being of firms and is thus of pivotal importance in risk analysis.When it comes to quantifying the extent of tail dependence, it is generally agreed that measures of tail dependence must be independent of the marginal distributions of the risks but rather solely copula-dependent. Indeed, all classical measures of tail dependence are such, but they investigate the amount of tail dependence along the main diagonal of copulas, which has often little in common with the concentration of extremes in the copulas' domain of definition.In this paper we urge that the classical measures of tail dependence may underestimate the level of tail dependence in copulas. For the Gaussian copula, however, we prove that the classical measures are maximal. The implication of the result is two-fold: On the one hand, it means that in the Gaussian case, the (weak) measures of tail dependence that have been reported and used are of utmost prudence, which must be a reassuring news for practitioners. On the other hand, it further encourages substitution of the Gaussian copula with other copulas that are more tail dependent.},

  abstract = {Copula modeling has become ubiquitous in modern statistics. Here, the problem of nonparametrically estimating a copula density is addressed. Arguably the most popular nonparametric density estimator, the kernel estimator is not suitable for the unit-square-supported copula densities, mainly because it is heavily affected by boundary bias issues. In addition, most common copulas admit unbounded densities, and kernel methods are not consistent in that case. In this paper, a kernel-type copula density estimator is proposed. It is based on the idea of transforming the uniform marginals of the copula density into normal distributions via the probit function, estimating the density in the transformed domain, which can be accomplished without boundary problems, and obtaining an estimate of the copula density through back-transformation. Although natural, a raw application of this procedure was, however, seen not to perform very well in the earlier literature. Here, it is shown that, if combined with local likelihood density estimation methods, the idea yields very good and easy to implement estimators, fixing boundary issues in a natural way and able to cope with unbounded copula densities. The asymptotic properties of the suggested estimators are derived, and a practical way of selecting the crucially important smoothing parameters is devised. Finally, extensive simulation studies and a real data analysis evidence their excellent performance compared to their main competitors.},

Sklar’s theorem, “the fundamental theorem of copulas”, makes a clear distinction between the continuous case and the discrete case, though. In particular, the copula of a discrete random vector is not fully identifiable, which causes serious inconsistencies. In spite of this, downplaying statements may be found in the related literature, where copula methods are used for modelling dependence between discrete variables. This paper calls to reconsidering the soundness of copula modelling for discrete data. It suggests a more fundamental construction which allows copula ideas to smoothly carry over to the discrete case. Actually it is an attempt at rejuvenating some century-old ideas of Udny Yule, who mentioned a similar construction a long time before copulas got in fashion.},

Rank-based procedures are often used in this context to guard against possible misspecification of the marginal distributions. A standard approach consists of maximizing the pseudo-likelihood. Here, we investigate alternative estimators based on the inversion of two multivariate extensions of Kendall's tau developed by Kendall and Babington Smith, and by Joe. The former, which amounts to the average value of tau over all pairs of variables, is often referred to as the coefficient of agreement. Existing results concerning the finite- and large-sample properties of this coefficient are summarized, and new, parallel findings are provided for the multivariate version of tau due to Joe, along with illustrations. The performance of the estimators resulting from the inversion of these two versions of Kendall's tau is compared in the context of copula models through simulations. © 2011 Australian Statistical Publishing Association Inc..},

  abstract = {It is being increasingly recognized that the uncertainty in weather forecasts should be quantified and furnished to users along with the single-value forecasts usually provided. Probabilistic forecasts of "events" have been made in special cases; for instance, probabilistic forecasts of the event defined as 0.01 in. or more of precipitation at a point over a specified time period [i.e., the probability of precipitation (PoP)] have been disseminated to the public by the Weather Bureau/National Weather Service since 1966. Within the past decade, ensembles of operational numerical weather prediction models have been produced and used to some degree to provide probabilistic estimates of events easily dealt with, such as the occurrence of specific amounts of precipitation. In most such applications, the number of ensembles restricts this "enumeration" method, and the ensembles are characteristically underdispersive. However, fewer attempts have been made to provide a probability density function (PDF) or cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a continuous variable. The Meteorological Development Laboratory (MDL) has used the error estimation capabilities of the linear regression framework and kernel density fitting applied to individual and aggregate ensemble members of the Global Ensemble Forecast System of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction to develop PDFs and CDFs. This paper describes the method and results for temperature, dewpoint, daytime maximum temperature, and nighttime minimum temperature. The method produces reliable forecasts with accuracy exceeding the raw ensembles. Points on the CDF for 1650 stations have been mapped to the National Digital Forecast Database 5-km grid and an example is provided.},

But as Gneiting and Raftery discuss in their Perspective, a new approach–ensemble forecasting–was introduced in the early 1990s. In this method, up to 100 different computer runs, each with slightly different starting conditions or model assumptions, are combined into a weather forecast. In concert with statistical techniques, ensembles can provide accurate statements about the uncertainty in daily and seasonal forecasting. The challenge now is to improve the modeling, statistical analysis, and visualization technologies for disseminating the ensemble results.}

  abstract = {Ensemble prediction systems typically show positive spread-error correlation, but they are subject to forecast bias and dispersion errors, and are therefore uncalibrated. This work proposes the use of ensemble model output statistics (EMOS), an easy-to-implement postprocessing technique that addresses both forecast bias and underdispersion and takes into account the spread-skill relationship. The technique is based on multiple linear regression and is akin to the superensemble approach that has traditionally been used for deterministic-style forecasts. The EMOS technique yields probabilistic forecasts that take the form of Gaussian predictive probability density functions (PDFs) for continuous weather variables and can be applied to gridded model output. The EMOS predictive mean is a bias-corrected weighted average of the ensemble member forecasts, with coefficients that can be interpreted in terms of the relative contributions of the member models to the ensemble, and provides a highly competitive deterministic-style forecast. The EMOS predictive variance is a linear function of the ensemble variance. For fitting the EMOS coefficients, the method of minimum continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) estimation is introduced. This technique finds the coefficient values that optimize the CRPS for the training data. The EMOS technique was applied to 48-h forecasts of sea level pressure and surface temperature over the North American Pacific Northwest in spring 2000, using the University of Washington mesoscale ensemble. When compared to the bias-corrected ensemble, deterministic-style EMOS forecasts of sea level pressure had root-mean-square error 9\% less and mean absolute error 7\% less. The EMOS predictive PDFs were sharp, and much better calibrated than the raw ensemble or the bias-corrected ensemble. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.},

We propose a diagnostic approach to the evaluation of predictive performance that is based on the paradigm of maximizing the sharpness of the predictive distributions subject to calibration. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the distributional forecasts and the observations and is a joint property of the predictions and the events that materialize. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and is a property of the forecasts only. A simple theoretical framework allows us to distinguish between probabilistic calibration, exceedance calibration and marginal calibration. We propose and study tools for checking calibration and sharpness, among them the probability integral transform histogram, marginal calibration plots, the sharpness diagram and proper scoring rules. The diagnostic approach is illustrated by an assessment and ranking of probabilistic forecasts of wind speed at the Stateline wind energy centre in the US Pacific Northwest. In combination with cross-validation or in the time series context, our proposal provides very general, nonparametric alternatives to the use of information criteria for model diagnostics and model selection. © 2007 Royal Statistical Society.},

  abstract = {The investment decision on the placement of wind turbines is, neglecting legal formalities, mainly driven by the aim to maximize the expected annual energy production of single turbines. The result is a concentration of wind farms at locations with high average wind speed. While this strategy may be optimal for single investors maximizing their own return on investment, the resulting overall allocation of wind turbines may be unfavorable for energy suppliers and the economy because of large fluctuations in the overall wind power output. This paper investigates to what extent optimal allocation of wind farms in Germany can reduce these fluctuations. We analyze stochastic dependencies of wind speed for a large data set of German on- and offshore weather stations and find that these dependencies turn out to be highly nonlinear but constant over time. Using copula theory we determine the value at risk of energy production for given allocation sets of wind farms and derive optimal allocation plans. We find that the optimized allocation of wind farms may substantially stabilize the overall wind energy supply on daily as well as hourly frequency. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            To assess the current dynamics of an epidemic, it is central to collect information on the daily number of newly diseased cases. This is especially important in real‐time surveillance, where the aim is to gain situational awareness, for example, if cases are currently increasing or decreasing. Reporting delays between disease onset and case reporting hamper our ability to understand the dynamics of an epidemic close to now when looking at the number of daily reported cases only. Nowcasting can be used to adjust daily case counts for occurred‐but‐not‐yet‐reported events. Here, we present a novel application of nowcasting to data on the current COVID‐19 pandemic in Bavaria. It is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model that considers changes in the reporting delay distribution over time and associated with the weekday of reporting. Furthermore, we present a way to estimate the effective time‐varying case reproduction number                              based on predictions of the nowcast. The approaches are based on previously published work, that we considerably extended and adapted to the current task of nowcasting COVID‐19 cases. We provide methodological details of the developed approach, illustrate results based on data of the current pandemic, and evaluate the model based on synthetic and retrospective data on COVID‐19 in Bavaria. Results of our nowcasting are reported to the Bavarian health authority and published on a webpage on a daily basis (               https://corona.stat.uni-muenchen.de/               ). Code and synthetic data for the analysis are available from               https://github.com/FelixGuenther/nc\_covid19\_bavaria               and can be used for adaption of our approach to different~data.},

It proposes a practical data-driven approach to the direct combination of density forecasts by taking a weighted linear combination of the competing density forecasts. The combination weights are chosen to minimize the 'distance', as measured by the Kullback-Leibler information criterion, between the forecasted and true but unknown density. We explain how this minimization both can and should be achieved but leave theoretical analysis to future research. Comparisons with the optimal combination of point forecasts are made. An application to simple time-series density forecasts and two widely used published density forecasts for U.K. inflation, namely the Bank of England and NIESR "fan" charts, illustrates that combination can but need not always help. © 2006 International Institute of Forecasters.},

  abstract = {Rank histograms are a tool for evaluating ensemble forecasts. They are useful for determining the reliability of ensemble forecasts and for diagnosing errors in its mean and spread. Rank histograms are generated by repeatedly tallying the rank of the verification (usually an observation) relative to values from an ensemble sorted from lowest to highest. However, an uncritical use of the rank histogram can lead to misinterpretations of the qualities of that ensemble. For example, a flat rank histogram, usually taken as a sign of reliability, can still be generated from unreliable ensembles. Similarly, a U-shaped rank histogram, commonly understood as indicating a lack of variability in the ensemble, can also be a sign of conditional bias. It is also shown that flat rank histograms can be generated for some model variables if the variance of the ensemble is correctly specified, yet if covariances between model grid points are improperly specified, rank histograms for combinations of model variables may not be flat. Further, if imperfect observations are used for verification, the observational errors should be accounted for, otherwise the shape of the rank histogram may mislead the user about the characteristics of the ensemble. If a statistical hypothesis test is to be performed to determine whether the differences from uniformity of rank are statistically significant, then samples used to populate the rank histogram must be located far enough away from each other in time and space to be considered independent.},

Bernstein's inequality does not appear anywhere in these notes (disgrace-ful!), nor do any Bernstein-type concentration inequalities (such as con-centration of the exponential distribution and Talagrand's concentration inequality for empirical processes) and the notion of modified log-Sobolev inequalities. These should be included at the end of Part I. b. Chaining with adaptive truncation and entropy with brackets. Beyond be-ing a classical topic in empirical process theory, the power of the idea of adaptive truncation has again proven its value in the recent solution of the long-standing Bernoulli problem due to Bednorz and Lata la.},

  abstract = {The largest obstacle that suppresses the increase of wind power penetration within the power grid is uncertainties and fluctuations in wind speeds. Therefore, accurate wind power forecasting is a challenging task, which can significantly impact the effective operation of power systems. Wind power forecasting is also vital for planning unit commitment, maintenance scheduling and profit maximisation of power traders. The current development of cost-effective operation and maintenance methods for modern wind turbines benefits from the advancement of effective and accurate wind power forecasting approaches. This paper systematically reviewed the state-of-the-art approaches of wind power forecasting with regard to physical, statistical (time series and artificial neural networks) and hybrid methods, including factors that affect accuracy and computational time in the predictive modelling efforts. Besides, this study provided a guideline for wind power forecasting process screening, allowing the wind turbine/farm operators to identify the most appropriate predictive methods based on time horizons, input features, computational time, error measurements, etc. More specifically, further recommendations for the research community of wind power forecasting were proposed based on reviewed literature.},

  abstract = {Summary               The bootstrap is a method for estimating the distribution of an estimator or test statistic by resampling one's data or a model estimated from the data. The methods that are available for implementing the bootstrap and the accuracy of bootstrap estimates depend on whether the data are an independent random sample or a time series. This paper is concerned with the application of the bootstrap to time‐series data when one does not have a finite‐dimensional parametric model that reduces the data generation process to independent random sampling. We review the methods that have been proposed for implementing the bootstrap in this situation and discuss the accuracy of these methods relative to that of first‐order asymptotic approximations. We argue that methods for implementing the bootstrap with time‐series data are not as well understood as methods for data that are independent random samples. Although promising bootstrap methods for time series are available, there is a considerable need for further research in the application of the bootstrap to time series. We describe some of the important unsolved problems.                                         Résumé               Le bootstrap est une méthode pour estimer la distribution d'un estimateur en rééchantillonnant ses données ou un modéle estiméà partir des données. Les méthodes disponibles pour mettre en oeuvre le bootstrap et la précision des estimateurs de bootstrap dépendent de ce que les données proviennent d'un échantillon aléatoire indépendant ou d'une série temporelle. Cet article concerne l'application du bootstrap aux données des séries temporelles quand on ne dispose pas de modéle paramétrique de dimension finie qui réduise le processus de génération des données à l'échantillonnage aléatoire indépendent. Nous examinons les méthodes qui ont été proposées pour mettre en oeuvre le bootstrap dans cette situation et discutons la precision de ces méthodes comparativement à celle des approximations asymptotiques de premier ordre. Nous montrons que les méthodes pour mettre en oeuvre le bootstrap avec les données des séries temporelles ne sont pas aussi bien comprises que les méthodes pour les données des échantillons aléatoires indépendants. Bien que des méthodes de bootstrap prometteuses pour les séries temporelles soient disponibles, il y a un besoin considérable de recherche supplémental re dans leur application.

The bootstrap provides statistical inferences—standard error and bias estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests—without assumptions such as Normal distributions or equal variances. As such, bootstrap methods can be remarkably more accurate than classical inferences based on Normal or               t               distributions. The bootstrap uses the same basic procedure regardless of the statistic being calculated, without requiring the use of application‐specific formulae. This article may provide two big surprises for many readers. The first is that the bootstrap shows that common               t               confidence intervals are woefully inaccurate when populations are skewed, with one‐sided coverage levels off by factors of two or more, even for very large samples. The second is that the number of bootstrap samples required is much larger than generally realized.

Analysis often proceeds by first selecting the best model according to some criterion and then learning about the parameters of this selected model. Crucially, however, in this approach the parameter estimates are conditioned on the selected model, and any uncertainty about the model-selection process is ignored. An alternative is to learn the parameters for all candidate models and then combine the estimates according to the posterior probabilities of the associated models. This approach is known as Bayesian model averaging (BMA). BMA has several important advantages over all-or-none selection methods, but has been used only sparingly in the social sciences. In this conceptual introduction, we explain the principles of BMA, describe its advantages over all-or-none model selection, and showcase its utility in three examples: analysis of covariance, meta-analysis, and network analysis.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               To assure the equivalence between new clinical measurement methods and the standard methods, the four-quadrant plot and the plot’s concordance rate is used in clinical practice, along with Bland-Altman analysis. The conventional concordance rate does not consider the correlation among the data on individual subjects, which may affect its proper evaluation.                                         Methods               We propose a new concordance rate for the four-quadrant plot based on multivariate normal distribution to take into account the covariance within each individual subject. The proposed concordance rate is formulated as the conditional probability of the agreement. It contains a parameter to set the minimum concordant number between two measurement methods, which is regarded as agreement. This parameter allows flexibility in the interpretation of the results.                                         Results               Through numerical simulations, the AUC value of the proposed method was 0.967, while that of the conventional concordance rate was 0.938. In the application to a real example, the AUC value of the proposed method was 0.999 and that of the conventional concordance rate was 0.964.                                         Conclusion               From the results of numerical simulations and a real example, the proposed concordance rate showed better accuracy and higher diagnosability than the conventional approaches.},

The wind power forecast error distribution assumed can have a large impact on the confidence intervals produced in wind power forecasting. In this work we examine the shape of the persistence model error distribution for ten different wind plants in the ERCOT system over multiple timescales. Comparisons are made between the experimental distribution shape and that of the normal distribution. The shape of the distribution is found to change significantly with the length of the forecasting timescale. The Cauchy distribution is proposed as a model distribution for the forecast errors and model parameters are fitted. Finally, the differences in confidence intervals obtained using the Cauchy distribution and the normal distribution are compared. © 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The advent of multiple-point geostatistics (MPS) gave rise to the integration of complex subsurface geological structures and features into the model by the concept of training images. Initial algorithms generate geologically realistic realizations by using these training images to obtain conditional probabilities needed in a stochastic simulation framework. More recent pattern-based geostatistical algorithms attempt to improve the accuracy of the training image pattern reproduction. In these approaches, the training image is used to construct a pattern database. Consequently, sequential simulation will be carried out by selecting a pattern from the database and pasting it onto the simulation grid. One of the shortcomings of the present algorithms is the lack of a unifying framework for classifying and modeling the patterns from the training image. In this paper, an entirely different approach will be taken toward geostatistical modeling. A novel, principled and unified technique for pattern analysis and generation that ensures computational efficiency and enables a straightforward incorporation of domain knowledge will be presented. In the developed methodology, patterns scanned from the training image are represented as points in a Cartesian space using multidimensional scaling. The idea behind this mapping is to use distance functions as a tool for analyzing variability between all the patterns in a training image. These distance functions can be tailored to the application at hand. Next, by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the problem and using kernel space mapping, an improved pattern classification algorithm is obtained. This paper discusses the various implementation details to accomplish these ideas. Several examples are presented and a qualitative comparison is made with previous methods. An improved pattern continuity and data-conditioning capability is observed in the generated realizations for both continuous and categorical variables. We show how the proposed methodology is much less sensitive to the user-provided parameters, and at the same time has the potential to reduce computational time significantly. © 2010 International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.},

The optimality conditions for this problem are formulated as a system of strongly semismooth functions. We show that the so-called local error bound condition does not hold for this system. Thus the guaranteed convergence rate of Newton-type methods is at most superlinear. By exploiting the problem structure, we construct a modified two step semismooth Newton method that guarantees a nonsingular Jacobian matrix at each iteration, and that converges to the nearest doubly stochastic matrix quadratically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Newton-type method which converges \$Q\$-quadratically in the absence of the local error bound condition.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Accurate forecasting of medical service demand is beneficial for the reasonable healthcare resource planning and allocation. The daily outpatient volume is characterized by randomness, periodicity and trend, and the time series methods, like ARIMA are often used for short-term outpatient visits forecasting. Therefore, to further enlarge the prediction horizon and improve the prediction accuracy, a hybrid prediction model integrating ARIMA and self-adaptive filtering method is proposed.                                         Methods               The ARIMA model is first used to identify the features like cyclicity and trend of the time series data and to estimate the model parameters. The parameters are then adjusted by the steepest descent algorithm in the adaptive filtering method to reduce the prediction error. The hybrid model is validated and compared with traditional ARIMA by several test sets from the Time Series Data Library (TSDL), a weekly emergency department (ED) visit case from literature study, and the real cases of prenatal examinations and B-ultrasounds in a maternal and child health care center (MCHCC) in Ningbo.                                         Results               For TSDL cases the prediction accuracy of the hybrid prediction is improved by 80–99\% compared with the ARIMA model. For the weekly ED visit case, the forecasting results of the hybrid model are better than those of both traditional ARIMA and ANN model, and similar to the ANN combined data decomposition model mentioned in the literature. For the actual data of MCHCC in Ningbo, the MAPE predicted by the ARIMA model in the two departments was 18.53 and 27.69\%, respectively, and the hybrid models were 2.79 and 1.25\%, respectively.                                         Conclusions               The hybrid prediction model outperforms the traditional ARIMA model in both accurate predicting result with smaller average relative error and the applicability for short-term and medium-term prediction.},

It also discusses other multivariate constructions and parametric copula families that have different tail properties and presents extensive material on dependence and tail properties to assist in copula model selection. The author shows how numerical methods and algorithms for inference and simulation are important in high-dimensional copula applications. He presents the algorithms as pseudocode, illustrating their implementation for high-dimensional copula models.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background:\enspace{}               Shifts in the supply of and demand for emergency department (ED) resources make the efficient allocation of ED resources increasingly important. Forecasting is a vital activity that guides decision‐making in many areas of economic, industrial, and scientific planning, but has gained little traction in the health care industry. There are few studies that explore the use of forecasting methods to predict patient volumes in the ED.                                         Objectives:\enspace{}               The goals of this study are to explore and evaluate the use of several statistical forecasting methods to predict daily ED patient volumes at three diverse hospital EDs and to compare the accuracy of these methods to the accuracy of a previously proposed forecasting method.                                         Methods:\enspace{}               Daily patient arrivals at three hospital EDs were collected for the period January 1, 2005, through March 31, 2007. The authors evaluated the use of seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, time series regression, exponential smoothing, and artificial neural network models to forecast daily patient volumes at each facility. Forecasts were made for horizons ranging from 1 to 30{$\quad$}days in advance. The forecast accuracy achieved by the various forecasting methods was compared to the forecast accuracy achieved when using a benchmark forecasting method already available in the emergency medicine literature.                                         Results:\enspace{}               All time series methods considered in this analysis provided improved in‐sample model goodness of fit. However, postsample analysis revealed that time series regression models that augment linear regression models by accounting for serial autocorrelation offered only small improvements in terms of postsample forecast accuracy, relative to multiple linear regression models, while seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, exponential smoothing, and artificial neural network forecasting models did not provide consistently accurate forecasts of daily ED volumes.                                         Conclusions:\enspace{}               This study confirms the widely held belief that daily demand for ED services is characterized by seasonal and weekly patterns. The authors compared several time series forecasting methods to a benchmark multiple linear regression model. The results suggest that the existing methodology proposed in the literature, multiple linear regression based on calendar variables, is a reasonable approach to forecasting daily patient volumes in the ED. However, the authors conclude that regression‐based models that incorporate calendar variables, account for site‐specific special‐day effects, and allow for residual autocorrelation provide a more appropriate, informative, and consistently accurate approach to forecasting daily ED patient volumes.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the use of multivariate distributions that are functions of their marginals for aggregating information from various sources. The function that links the marginals is called a copula. The information to be aggregated can be point estimates of an unknown quantity 9 or, with suitable modeling assumptions, probability distributions for 6. This approach allows the Bayesian decision maker performing the aggregation to separate two difficult aspects of the model-construction procedure. Qualities of the individual sources, such as bias and precision, are incorporated into the marginal distributions. Dependence among sources is encoded into the copula, which serves as a dependence function and joins the marginal distributions into a single multivariate distribution. The procedure is designed to be suitable for situations in which the decision maker must use subjective judgments as a basis for constructing the aggregation model. We review properties of copulas pertinent to the information-aggregation problem. A subjectively assessable measure of dependence is developed that allows the decision maker to choose from a one-parameter family of copulas a specific member that is appropriate for the level of dependence among the information sources. The discussion then focuses on the class of Archimedean copulas and Frank's family of copulas in particular, showing the specific relationship between the family and our measure of dependence. A realistic example demonstrates the approach.},

  abstract = {Aims: The aim of this research was to study health-related and sociodemographic determinants of the use of different complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments in Europe and differences in CAM use in various European countries. Methods: The study was based on a design-based logistic regression analysis of the European Social Survey (ESS), Round 7. We distinguished four CAM modalities: manual therapies, alternative medicinal systems, traditional Asian medical systems and mind-body therapies. Results: In total, 25.9\% of the general population had used CAM during the last 12 months. Typically, only one CAM treatment had been used, and it was used more often as complementary rather than alternative treatment. The use of CAM varied greatly by country, from 10\% in Hungary to almost 40\% in Germany. Compared to those in good health, the use of CAM was two to fourfold greater among those with health problems. The health profiles of users of different CAM modalities varied. For example, back or neck pain was associated with all types of CAM, whereas depression was associated only with the use of mind-body therapies. Individuals with difficult to diagnose health conditions were more inclined to utilize CAM, and CAM use was more common among women and those with a higher education. Lower income was associated with the use of mind-body therapies, whereas the other three CAM modalities were associated with higher income. Conclusions: Help-seeking differed according to the health problem, something that should be acknowledged by clinical professionals to ensure safe care. The findings also point towards possible socioeconomic inequalities in health service use.},

  abstract = {In psychological work the problem of comparing two different rankings of the same set of individuals may be divided into two types. In the first type the individuals have a given order A which is objectively defined with reference to some quality, and a characteristic question is: if an observer ranks the individuals in an order B, does a comparison of B with A suggest that he possesses a reliable judgment of the quality, or, alternatively, is it probable that B could have arisen by chance? In the second type no objective order is given. Two observers consider the individuals and rank them in orders A and B. The question now is, are these orders sufficiently alike to indicate similarity of taste in the observers, or, on the other hand, are A and B incompatible within assigned limits of probability 1 An example of the first type occurs in the familiar experiments wherein an observer has to arrange a known set of weights in ascending order of weight; the second type would arise if two observers had to rank a set of musical compositions in order of preference. The measure of rank correlation proposed in this paper is capable of being applied to both problems, which are, in fact, formally very much the same. For purposes of simplicity in the exposition it has, however, been thought convenient to preserve a distinction between them.}

  abstract = {Accurate weather benefit many key societal functions and activities, including agriculture, transportation, recreation, and basic human and infrastructural safety. Over the past two decades, ensembles of numerical weather prediction models have been developed, in which multiple estimates of the current state of the atmosphere are used to generate probabilistic forecasts for future weather events. However, ensemble systems are uncalibrated and biased, and thus need to be statistically postprocessed. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is a preferred way of doing this. Particularly for quantitative precipitation, biases and calibration errors depend critically on local terrain features. We introduce a geostatistical approach to modeling locally varying BMA parameters, as opposed to the extant method that holds parameters constant across the forecast domain. Degeneracies caused by enduring dry periods are overcome by Bayesian regularization and Laplace approximations. The new approach, called geostatistical model averaging (GMA), was applied to 48-hour-ahead forecasts of daily precipitation accumulation over the North American Pacific Northwest, using the eight-member University of Washington Mesoscale Ensemble. GMA had better aggregate and local calibration than the extant technique, and was sharper on average. © 2011 American Statistical Association.},

In the literature, three testing approaches can be found that take this problem into account. However, these approaches rely on data-dependent critical values, ignore important information and, therefore lack power, or suffer from size distortions even asymptotically. This article proposes a new testing approach based on raw moments. It is extremely easy to implement, uses standard critical values, can include all moments regarded as important, and has correct asymptotic size. It is found to have good size and power properties in finite samples if it is based on the (standardized) probability integral transforms.},

Conditional on this factor, the distribution of these variables is given by the Gaussian copula with a time-varying correlation matrix, and some observed driving variables can be used to model dynamic correlations. This structure allows one to build flexible and parsimonious models for multivariate data with non-Gaussian dependence that changes over time. The model is computationally tractable in high dimensions and the numerical maximum likelihood estimation is feasible. The proposed class of models is applied to analyze three financial data sets of bond yields, CDS spreads and stock returns. The estimated model is used to construct projected distributions and, for the bond yield and CDS spread datasets, compute the expected maximum number of investments in distress under different scenarios.},

A copula based approach couples marginal distributions to form flexible multivariate distribution functions. The appeal of copula approach lies in the fact that it eliminates the implied reliance on the multivariate normal or the assumption that dimensions are independent.

This paper compares two nonlinear projection methods: Isomap and Curvilinear Distance Analysis. Contrarily to the traditional linear PCA, these methods work like multidimensional scaling, by reproducing in the projection space the pair-wise distances measured in the data space. They differ from the classical linear MDS by the metrics they use and by the way they build the mapping (algebraic or neural). While Isomap relies directly on the traditional MDS, CDA is based on a nonlinear variant of MDS, called CCA (Curvi-linear Component Analysis). Although Isomap and CDA share the same metrics, the comparison highlights their respective strengths and weaknesses .},

  abstract = {The accurate prediction of ambulance demand provides great value to emergency service providers and people living within a city. It supports the rational and dynamic allocation of ambulances and hospital staffing, and ensures patients have timely access to such resources. However, this task has been challenging due to complex multi-nature dependencies and nonlinear dynamics within ambulance demand, such as spatial characteristics involving the region of the city at which the demand is estimated, short and long-term historical demands, as well as the demographics of a region. Machine learning techniques are thus useful to quantify these characteristics of ambulance demand. However, there is generally a lack of studies that use machine learning tools for a comprehensive modeling of the important demand dependencies to predict ambulance demands. In this paper, an original and novel approach that leverages machine learning tools and extraction of features based on the multi-nature insights of ambulance demands is proposed. We experimentally evaluate the performance of next-day demand prediction across several state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and ambulance demand prediction methods, using real-world ambulatory and demographical datasets obtained from Singapore. We also provide an analysis of this ambulatory dataset and demonstrate the accuracy in modeling dependencies of different natures using various machine learning techniques.},

  abstract = {A simulation study was conducted to examine the performance of several confidence intervals (CIs) for Kendall's tau (txy) under a variety of population conditions. Two normal population variables (N = 10,000) were transformed to have tau correlations, τ = 0, .19, .41, or .71. Samples (n = 10, 50, 200) were drawn from the transformed populations 2000 times under each level of correlation, and accompanying CIs were computed on each sample. The results show that the CI for τ based on a consistent estimate of the variance of txy has the best coverage and power among a number of alternatives. Kendall's txy is unaffected by non-normality induced by monotonic transformations and, with its consistent variance estimated from the sample, performs well under a wide range of conditions.},

  abstract = {Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is a popular approach to combine hydrologic forecasts from individual models and characterize the uncertainty induced by model structure. In the original form of BMA, the conditional probability density function (PDF) of each model is assumed to be a particular probability distribution (e.g.; Gaussian, gamma, etc.). If the predictions of any hydrologic model do not follow certain distribution, a data transformation procedure is required prior to model averaging. Moreover, it is strongly recommended to apply BMA on unbiased forecasts, whereas it is sometimes difficult to effectively remove bias from the predictions of complex hydrologic models. To overcome these limitations, we develop an approach to integrate a group of multivariate functions, the so-called copula functions, into BMA. Here we introduce a copula-embedded BMA (Cop-BMA) method that relaxes any assumption on the shape of conditional PDFs. Copula functions have a flexible structure and do not restrict the shape of posterior distributions. Furthermore, copulas are effective tools in removing bias from hydrologic forecasts. To compare the performance of BMA with Cop-BMA, they are applied to hydrologic forecasts from different rainfall-runoff and land-surface models. We consider the streamflow observation and simulations for 10 river basins provided by the Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) project. Results demonstrate that the predictive distributions are more accurate and reliable, less biased, and more confident with small uncertainty after Cop-BMA application. It is also shown that the postprocessed forecasts have better correlation with observation after Cop-BMA application.},

  abstract = {This study examined the applicability of artificial neural network models in modelling univariate time series ambulance demand for short-term forecasting horizons in Zimbabwe. Bulawayo City Councils’ ambulance services department was used as a case study. Two models, feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, (SARIMA) were developed using monthly historical data from 2010 to 2017 and compared against observed data for 2018. The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and paired sample                                t                              -test were used as performance measures. Calculated performance measures for FFNN were MAE (94               .               0), RMSE (137               .               19), and the test statistic value                                p                 =                 0.493                              ({$>$}0               .               05) whilst corresponding values for SARIMA were 105               .               71, 125               .               28, and                                p                 =                 0.005                              (               {$<$}               0               .               05), respectively. Findings of this study suggest that the FFNN model is inclined to value estimation whilst the SARIMA model is directional with a linear pattern over time. Based on the performance measures, the parsimonious FFNN model was selected to predict short-term annual ambulance demand. Demand forecasts with FFNN for 2019 reflected the expected general trends in Bulawayo. The forecasts indicate high demand during the months of January, March, September, and December. Key ambulance logistic activities such as vehicle servicing, replenishment of essential equipment and drugs, staff training, leave days scheduling, and mock drills need to be planned for April, June, and July when low demand is anticipated. This deliberate planning strategy would avoid a dire situation whereby ambulances are available but without adequate staff, essential drugs, and equipment to respond to public emergency calls.},

Both approaches are Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and can cope with ˛at priors. We carry out simulation studies to determine and compare the efficiency of the algorithms.

This book provides a comprehensive treatment of the theoretical concepts and modelling techniques of quantitative risk management and equips readers--whether financial risk analysts, actuaries, regulators, or students of quantitative finance--with practical tools to solve real-world problems. The authors cover methods for market, credit, and operational risk modelling; place standard industry approaches on a more formal footing; and describe recent developments that go beyond, and address main deficiencies of, current practice.The book's methodology draws on diverse quantitative disciplines, from mathematical finance through statistics and econometrics to actuarial mathematics. Main concepts discussed include loss distributions, risk measures, and risk aggregation and allocation principles. A main theme is the need to satisfactorily address extreme outcomes and the dependence of key risk drivers. The techniques required derive from multivariate statistical analysis, financial time series modelling, copulas, and extreme value theory. A more technical chapter addresses credit derivatives. Based on courses taught to masters students and professionals, this book is a unique and fundamental reference that is set to become a standard in the field. © 2005 by Princeton University Press.

V-transforms describe the relationship between quantiles of the stationary distribution of the time series and quantiles of the distribution of a predictable volatility proxy variable. They can be represented as copulas and permit the formulation and estimation of models that combine arbitrary marginal distributions with copula processes for the dynamics of the volatility proxy. The idea is illustrated using a Gaussian ARMA copula process and the resulting model is shown to replicate many of the stylized facts of financial return series and to facilitate the calculation of marginal and conditional characteristics of the model including quantile measures of risk. Estimation is carried out by adapting the exact maximum likelihood approach to the estimation of ARMA processes, and the model is shown to be competitive with standard GARCH in an empirical application to Bitcoin return data.},

  title = {Kernel {{PCS}} and {{De-Noising}} in {{Feature Spaces}}},
  author = {Mika, Sebastian and Scholkopf, Bernhard and Smola, Alex and Muller, Klaus-Robert and Scholz, Matthias and Riitsch, Gunnar},
  abstract = {Kernel PCA as a nonlinear feature extractor has proven powerful as a preprocessing step for classification algorithms. But it can also be considered as a natural generalization of linear principal component analysis. This gives rise to the question how to use nonlinear features for data compression, reconstruction, and de-noising, applications common in linear PCA. This is a nontrivial task, as the results provided by kernel PCA live in some high dimensional feature space and need not have pre-images in input space. This work presents ideas for finding approximate pre-images, focusing on Gaussian kernels, and shows experimental results using these pre-images in data reconstruction and de-noising on toy examples as well as on real world data. 1 peA and Feature Spaces Principal Component Analysis (PC A) (e.g. [3]) is an orthogonal basis transformation. The new basis is found by diagonalizing the centered covariance matrix of a data set \{Xk E RNlk = 1, ... ,f\}, defined by C = ((Xi-(Xk))(Xi-(Xk))T). The coordinates in the Eigenvector basis are called principal components. The size of an Eigenvalue {$>$}. corresponding to an Eigenvector v of C equals the amount of variance in the direction of v. Furthermore, the directions of the first n Eigenvectors corresponding to the biggest n Eigenvalues cover as much variance as possible by n orthogonal directions. In many applications they contain the most interesting information: for instance, in data compression, where we project onto the directions with biggest variance to retain as much information as possible, or in de-noising, where we deliberately drop directions with small variance. Clearly, one cannot assert that linear PCA will always detect all structure in a given data set. By the use of suitable nonlinear features, one can extract more information. Kernel PCA is very well suited to extract interesting nonlinear structures in the data [9]. The purpose of this work is therefore (i) to consider nonlinear de-noising based on Kernel PCA and (ii) to clarify the connection between feature space expansions and meaningful patterns in input space. Kernel PCA first maps the data into some feature space F via a (usually nonlinear) function},

Parallels with the comparison and combination of point forecasts are made. This and related Monte Carlo experiments help draw out properties of combined density forecasts.

This was motivated by an example in which some standard evaluation procedures using probability integral transforms cannot distinguish the ideal forecast from several competing forecasts. We show that this example has some unrealistic features from a time series forecasting perspective, and so provides insecure foundations for the argument that existing calibration procedures are inadequate in practice. Our alternative, more realistic example shows how relevant statistical methods, including information-based methods, provide the required discrimination between competing forecasts.

Previous work combining density forecasts, using so-called “opinion pools”, has essentially ignored dependence. The proposed basis for modelling the dependence among di.erent experts’ densities is a recalibration function, based on the probability integral transforms of the expert densities. We show that this reduces to a copula function in a special case. We explore the properties of various approximations to the recalibration function both via Monte Carlo simulations and in an application density forecasting U.K. inflation using the Bank of England’s “fan” chart. We find that the copula opinion pool can deliver more accurate densities than traditional linear and logarithmic opinion pools in many realistic situations when historical data on expert performance are available.}

  abstract = {The planted partition model (also known as the stochastic blockmodel) is a classical cluster-exhibiting random graph model that has been extensively studied in statistics, physics, and computer science. In its simplest form, the planted partition model is a model for random graphs on \$n\$ nodes with two equal-sized clusters, with an between-class edge probability of \$q\$ and a within-class edge probability of \$p\$. Although most of the literature on this model has focused on the case of increasing degrees (ie.\textbackslash{} \$pn, qn \textbackslash to \textbackslash infty\$ as \$n \textbackslash to \textbackslash infty\$), the sparse case \$p, q = O(1/n)\$ is interesting both from a mathematical and an applied point of view. A striking conjecture of Decelle, Krzkala, Moore and Zdeborov\textbackslash 'a based on deep, non-rigorous ideas from statistical physics gave a precise prediction for the algorithmic threshold of clustering in the sparse planted partition model. In particular, if \$p = a/n\$ and \$q = b/n\$, then Decelle et al.\textbackslash{} conjectured that it is possible to cluster in a way correlated with the true partition if \$(a - b)\^{}2 {$>$} 2(a + b)\$, and impossible if \$(a - b)\^{}2 {$<$} 2(a + b)\$. By comparison, the best-known rigorous result is that of Coja-Oghlan, who showed that clustering is possible if \$(a - b)\^{}2 {$>$} C (a + b)\$ for some sufficiently large \$C\$. We prove half of their prediction, showing that it is indeed impossible to cluster if \$(a - b)\^{}2 {$<$} 2(a + b)\$. Furthermore we show that it is impossible even to estimate the model parameters from the graph when \$(a - b)\^{}2 {$<$} 2(a + b)\$; on the other hand, we provide a simple and efficient algorithm for estimating \$a\$ and \$b\$ when \$(a - b)\^{}2 {$>$} 2(a + b)\$. Following Decelle et al, our work establishes a rigorous connection between the clustering problem, spin-glass models on the Bethe lattice and the so called reconstruction problem. This connection points to fascinating applications and open problems.},

They build a high dimensional probability density from the product of marginals densities and bivariate copula densities. Besides parametric models, several approaches to nonparametric estimation of vine copulas have been proposed. In this article, we extend these approaches and compare them in an extensive simulation study and a real data application.We identify several factors driving the relative performance of the estimators. The most important one is the strength of dependence. No method was found to be uniformly better than all others. Overall, the kernel estimators performed best, but do worse than penalized B-spline estimators when there is weak dependence and no tail dependence.},

This chapter reviews the growing literature on copula-based models for economic and financial time series data, and discusses in detail methods for estimation, inference, goodness-of-fit testing, and model selection that are useful when working with these models.

  abstract = {Background               Limitations in the imaging views that can be obtained with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) have hindered development of a widely adopted Doppler method for cardiac output (CO) monitoring. The authors evaluated a CO technique that combines steerable continuous-wave Doppler with the imaging capabilities of two-dimensional multiplane TEE.                                         Methods               From the transverse plane transgastric, short-axis view of the left ventricle, the imaging array was rotated to view the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and ascending aorta. Steerable continuous-wave Doppler was subsequently used to measure aortic blood flow velocities. Aortic valve area was determined using a triangular orifice model. Matched thermodilution and Doppler CO measurements were obtained serially during surgery.                                         Results               The left ventricular outflow tract was imaged in 32 of 33 patients (97\%). Data analysis reveal a mean difference between techniques of -0.01 l/min, and a standard deviation of the differences of 0.56 l/min. Multiple regression showed a correlation of r = 0.98 between intrasubject changes in CO. Multiplane TEE correctly tracked the direction of 37 of 38 serial changes in thermodilution CO but with a modest 14\% underestimation of the magnitude of these changes.                                         Conclusions               These results indicate that multiplane TEE can provide an alternative method for the intraoperative measurement of CO. The ability of the rotatable imaging array to align with the left ventricular outflow tract and the need for only minimal adjustments in probe position advance the utility of intraoperative TEE.},

Using a logarithmic transformation, we show that the mechanics of the test are formally equivalent to a two-factor analysis of variance procedure when the residual variance is known, a priori. In addition to testing stationarity, the analysis provides also a method for testing whether the observed series fits a "uniformly modulated" model, and a test for "randomness" (constancy of spectra).},

The detrimental effects of imperfect models and initial conditions on the quality of such forecasts can be mitigated by calibration. This paper shows that Bayesian methods currently used to incorporate prior information can be written as special cases of a beta-binomial model and correspond to a linear calibration of the relative frequencies. These methods are compared with a nonlinear calibration technique (i.e., logistic regression) using real precipitation forecasts. Calibration is found to be advantageous in all cases considered, and logistic regression is preferable to linear methods. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

  abstract = {Ensembles used for probabilistic weather forecasting often exhibit a spread-error correlation, but they tend to be underdispersive. This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which is a standard method for combining predictive distributions from different sources. The BMA predictive probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest is a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights are equal to posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts and reflect the models' relative contributions to predictive skill over the training period. The BMA weights can be used to assess the usefulness of ensemble members, and this can be used as a basis for selecting ensemble members; this can be useful given the cost of running large ensembles. The BMA PDF can be represented as an unweighted ensemble of any desired size, by simulating from the BMA predictive distribution. The BMA predictive var iance can be decomposed into two components, one corresponding to the between-forecast variability, and the second to the within-forecast variability. Predictive PDFs or intervals based solely on the ensemble spread incorporate the first component but not the second. Thus BMA provides a theoretical explanation of the tendency of ensembles to exhibit a spread-error correlation but yet be underdispersive. The method was applied to 48-h forecasts of surface te mperature in the Pacific Northwest in January-June 2000 using the University of Washington fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) ensemble. The predictive PDFs were much better calibrated than the raw ensemble, and the BMA forecasts were sharp in that 90\% BMA prediction intervals were 66\% shorter on average than those produced by sample climatology. As a by-product, BMA yields a deterministic point forecast, and this had root-mean-square errors 7\% lower than the best of the ensemble members and 8\% lower than the ensemble mean. Similar results were obtained for forecasts of sea level pressure. Simulation experiments show that BMA performs reasonably well when the underlying ensemble is calibrated, or even overdispersed. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.},

  abstract = {Linear pooling is by far the most popular method for combining probability forecasts. However, any non-trivial weighted average of two or more distinct, calibrated probability forecasts is necessarily uncalibrated and lacks sharpness. In view of this, linear pooling requires recalibration, even in the ideal case in which the individual forecasts are calibrated. Towards this end, we propose a beta-transformed linear opinion pool for the aggregation of probability forecasts from distinct, calibrated or uncalibrated sources. The method fits an optimal non-linearly recalibrated forecast combination, by compositing a beta transform and the traditional linear opinion pool. The technique is illustrated in a simulation example and in a case-study on statistical and National Weather Service probability of precipitation forecasts. © 2010 Royal Statistical Society.},

The theory is applied to data in two way tables with variables in one category and samples (individual or populations) in the other. Two types of data are considered, one with continuous measurements on the variables and another with frequencies of attributes. An alternative to the usual correspondence analysis of contingency tables based on the Hellinger rather than the chi-square distance is suggested. The new method has some attractive features and does not suffer from some inherent drawbacks resulting from the use of the chi-square distance and variable sample sizes for the populations in the correspondence analysis. The technique of biplots where the populations and the variables are represented on the same chart is discussed.},

  abstract = {Networks or graphs can easily represent a diverse set of data sources that are characterized by interacting units or actors. Social networks, representing people who communicate with each other, are one example. Communities or clusters of highly connected actors form an essential feature in the structure of several empirical networks. Spectral clustering is a popular and computationally feasible method to discover these communities. The stochastic blockmodel [Social Networks 5 (1983) 109-137] is a social network model with well-defined communities; each node is a member of one community. For a network generated from the Stochastic Blockmodel, we bound the number of nodes "misclustered" by spectral clustering. The asymptotic results in this paper are the first clustering results that allow the number of clusters in the model to grow with the number of nodes, hence the name high-dimensional. In order to study spectral clustering under the stochastic blockmodel, we first show that under the more general latent space model, the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian asymptotically converge to the eigenvectors of a "population" normalized graph Laplacian. Aside from the implication for spectral clustering, this provides insight into a graph visualization technique. Our method of studying the eigenvectors of random matrices is original. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2011.},

Our approach is based on applying the well-known Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to a reformulation of the original problem. Our resulting algorithm requires an initial Cholesky factorization of a positive definite matrix that has the same sparsity pattern as C + I followed by simple iterations whose complexity is linear in the number of nonzeros in C, thus ensuring excellent scalability and speed. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach in a series of experiments on problems with up to 82 million nonzeros; these include normalizing large scale matrices arising from the 3D structure of the human genome, clustering applications, and the SuiteSparse matrix library. Overall, our experiments illustrate the outstanding scalability of our algorithm; matrices with millions of nonzeros can be approximated in a few seconds on modest desktop computing hardware.}

  abstract = {The measurement of arterial pressure (AP) is a key component of hemodynamic monitoring. A variety of different innovative AP monitoring technologies became recently available. The decision to use these technologies must be based on their measurement performance in validation studies. These studies are AP method comparison studies comparing a new method (“test method”) with a reference method. In these studies, different comparative statistical tests are used including correlation analysis, Bland-Altman analysis, and trending analysis. These tests provide information about the statistical agreement without adequately providing information about the clinical relevance of differences between the measurement methods. To overcome this problem, we, in this study, propose an “error grid analysis” for AP method comparison studies that allows illustrating the clinical relevance of measurement differences. We constructed smoothed consensus error grids with calibrated risk zones derived from a survey among 25 specialists in anesthesiology and intensive care medicine. Differences between measurements of the test and the reference method are classified into 5 risk levels ranging from “no risk” to “dangerous risk”; the classification depends on both the differences between the measurements and on the measurements themselves. Based on worked examples and data from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database, we show that the proposed error grids give information about the clinical relevance of AP measurement differences that cannot be obtained from Bland-Altman analysis. Our approach also offers a framework on how to adapt the error grid analysis for different clinical settings and patient populations.},

We employ a multivariate GARCH model in which the dependence structure between the assets is modelled via a vine copula. We address the problem of how the parametric pair-copulas in a vine copula should be chosen by proposing to use nonparametric Bernstein copulas as bivariate pair-copulas. An extensive simulation study illustrates that our smooth nonparametric vine copula model is able to match the results of a competing parametric vine model calibrated via Akaike’s Information Criterion while at the same time significantly reducing model risk. Our empirical analysis of financial market data demonstrates that our proposed model yields Value-at-Risk forecasts that are significantly more accurate than those of a benchmark parametric model.},

Moreover, rigorous analysis shows that the empirical linear B-spline copulas are more effective than empirical copulas to estimate perfectly dependent copulas. For the cases of nonperfectly dependent copulas, simulations show that the empirical linear B-spline copulas also improve the empirical copulas to estimate the underlying copula structure. Furthermore, we compare the performance of parametric estimation of copulas based on the empirical copulas with that based on the empirical linear B-spline copulas by simulations. In most of the cases, the latter are better than the former. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here, an alternative is proposed, where nonlinear serial and cross-sectional dependence is captured by a copula model. The copula defines a multivariate time series on the unit cube. A drawable vine copula is employed, along with a factorization which allows the marginal and transitional densities of the time series to be expressed analytically. The factorization also provides for simple conditions under which the series is stationary and/or Markov, as well as being parsimonious. A parallel algorithm for computing the likelihood is proposed, along with a Bayesian approach for computing inference based on model averages over parsimonious representations of the vine copula. The model average estimates are shown to be more accurate in a simulation study. Two five-dimensional time series from the Australian electricity market are examined. In both examples, the fitted copula captures a substantial level of asymmetric tail dependence, both over time and between elements in the series.},

Only a few studies have explored length and variability of waiting times among patients. This study is an attempt to understand factors affecting waiting time experienced by patients in outpatient clinics.Methods: For this study, data were collected in 2012 from 830 patients seeking care from outpatient clinics located in 30 randomly selected hospitals in the district of Nellore, India. Linear regression and logistic regression models have been used to identify the effect of various determinants on hospital waiting times.Results: The average waiting time in government hospitals was 20.3 minutes compared to 15.5 minutes in private hospitals and 39.71 minutes in voluntary hospitals. Waiting time of men was about six minutes lower than women. After controlling for other patient related and hospital related factors, median wait time was 19\% lower for male patients compared to females. Length of waiting declines with patient's age. Patients arriving by ambulance waited 64\% less that patients not arriving by ambulance but this pattern was not valid for public hospitals.Conclusions: Significant gender bias was present in all facility-types implying that policy and legal interventions would be required. For-profit hospitals had lower waiting time of patients to ensure higher demand for their services by the economically better-off sections of the population. The results highlight the importance of lowering the waiting time in public sector hospitals, especially for patients arriving in ambulances.},

Model averaging is a natural and formal response to model uncertainty in a Bayesian framework, and most of the paper deals with Bayesian model averaging. The important role of the prior assumptions in these Bayesian procedures is highlighted. In addition, frequentist model averaging methods are also discussed. Numerical techniques to implement these methods are explained, and I point the reader to some freely available computational resources. The main focus is on uncertainty regarding the choice of covariates in normal linear regression models, but the paper also covers other, more challenging, settings, with particular emphasis on sampling models commonly used in economics. Applications of model averaging in economics are reviewed and discussed in a wide range of areas including growth economics, production modeling, finance and forecasting macroeconomic quantities.

Although the forecasts based on individual predictors are unstable over time and across countries, and on average perform worse than an autoregressive benchmark, the combination forecasts often improve upon autoregressive forecasts. Despite the unstable performance of the constituent forecasts, the most successful combination forecasts, like the mean, are the least sensitive to the recent performance of the individual forecasts. While consistent with other evidence on the success of simple combination forecasts, this finding is difficult to explain using the theory of combination forecasting in a stationary environment.

This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on quantile regression forests (QRF), a generalization of random forests for quantile regression. This method does not fit a parametric probability density function (PDF) like in ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) but provides an estimation of desired quantiles. This is a nonparametric approach that eliminates any assumption on the variable subject to calibration. This method can estimate quantiles using not only members of the ensemble but any predictor available including statistics on other variables. The method is applied to the Météo-France 35-member ensemble forecast (PEARP) for surface temperature and wind speed for available lead times from 3 up to 54 h and compared to EMOS. All postprocessed ensembles are much better calibrated than the PEARP raw ensemble and experiments on real data also show that QRF performs better than EMOS, and can bring a real gain for human forecasters compared to EMOS. QRF provides sharp and reliable probabilistic forecasts. At last, classical scoring rules to verify predictive forecasts are completed by the introduction of entropy as a general measure of reliability.},

The uncertainty in wind generation is very large due to the inherent variability in wind speed, and this needs to be understood by operators of power systems and wind farms. To assist with the management of this risk, this paper investigates methods for predicting the probability density function of generated wind power from one to ten days ahead at five U.K. wind farm locations. These density forecasts provide a description of the expected future value and the associated uncertainty. We construct density forecasts from weather ensemble predictions, which are a relatively new type of weather forecast generated from atmospheric models. We also consider density forecasting from statistical time series models. The best results for wind power density prediction and point forecasting were produced by an approach that involves calibration and smoothing of the ensemble-based wind power density. © 2009 IEEE.},

This article proposes new methods for empirically assessing forecast calibration in a multivariate setting where the probabilistic forecast is given by an ensemble of equally probable forecast scenarios. Multivariate properties are mapped to a single dimension through a prerank function and the calibration is subsequently assessed visually through a histogram of the ranks of the observation’s preranks. Average ranking assigns a prerank based on the average univariate rank while band depth ranking employs the concept of functional band depth where the centrality of the observation within the forecast ensemble is assessed. Several simulation examples and a case study of temperature forecast trajectories at Berlin Tegel Airport in Germany demonstrate that both multivariate ranking methods can successfully detect various sources of miscalibration and scale efficiently to high-dimensional settings. Supplemental material in form of computer code is available online.},

  abstract = {Statistical postprocessing techniques are nowadays key components of the forecasting suites in many national meteorological services (NMS), with, for most of them, the objective of correcting the impact of different types of errors on the forecasts. The final aim is to provide optimal, automated, seamless forecasts for end users. Many techniques are now flourishing in the statistical, meteorological, climatological, hydrological, and engineering communities. The methods range in complexity from simple bias corrections to very sophisticated distribution-adjusting techniques that incorporate correlations among the prognostic variables. The paper is an attempt to summarize the main activities going on in this area from theoretical developments to operational applications, with a focus on the current challenges and potential avenues in the field. Among these challenges is the shift in NMS toward running ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems at the kilometer scale that produce very large datasets and require high-density high-quality observations, the necessity to preserve space–time correlation of high-dimensional corrected fields, the need to reduce the impact of model changes affecting the parameters of the corrections, the necessity for techniques to merge different types of forecasts and ensembles with different behaviors, and finally the ability to transfer research on statistical postprocessing to operations. Potential new avenues are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns the evaluation and combination of subjective probability estimates for categorical events. We argue that the appropriate criterion for evaluating individual and combined estimates depends on the type of uncertainty the decision maker seeks to represent, which in turn depends on his or her model of the event space. Decision makers require accurate estimates in the presence of aleatory uncertainty about exchangeable events, diagnostic estimates given epistemic uncertainty about unique events, and some combination of the two when the events are not necessarily unique, but the best equivalence class de®nition for exchangeable events is not apparent. Following a brief reveiw of the mathematical and empirical literature on combining judgments, we present an approach to the topic that derives from (1) a weak cognitive model of the individual that assumes subjective estimates are a function of underlying judgment perturbed by random error and (2) a classi®cation of judgment contexts in terms of the underlying information structure. In support of our developments, we present new analyses of two sets of subjective probability estimates, one of exchangeable and the other of unique events. As predicted, mean estimates were more accurate than the individual values in the ®rst case and more diagnostic in the second. \#1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We first develop a robust face tracking algorithm based on the local sparse appearance. This sparse representation model exploits both partial and spatial information of the face based on a covariance pooling method. Following in the face recognition stage, with the employment of a novel template update strategy, our recognition algorithm adapts the template to appearance change and reduces the influence of occlusion and illumination variation. In the experiments, we test the quality of face recognition in real-world noisy videos on YouTube database. Our proposed method produces a high face recognition results on over 93\% of all videos. The tracking results on challenging videos demonstrate that the proposed tracking algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods. On the challenging data set in which faces are undergo occlusion and illumination variation, our proposed method also consistently demonstrates a high recognition rate. © 2013 IEEE.},

We establish the theoretical properties of the new estimator and its automatic higher-order improvement under Gaussian copulas. We present two practical methods of smoothing parameter selection. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the competence of the proposed estimator in terms of global and tail performance. Two real-world examples are provided.

  abstract = {Real-time surveillance is a crucial element in the response to infectious disease outbreaks. However, the interpretation of incidence data is often hampered by delays occurring at various stages of data gathering and reporting. As a result, recent values are biased downward, which obscures current trends. Statistical nowcasting techniques can be employed to correct these biases, allowing for accurate characterization of recent developments and thus enhancing situational awareness. In this paper, we present a preregistered real-time assessment of eight nowcasting approaches, applied by independent research teams to German 7-day hospitalization incidences during the COVID-19 pandemic. This indicator played an important role in the management of the outbreak in Germany and was linked to levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions via certain thresholds. Due to its definition, in which hospitalization counts are aggregated by the date of case report rather than admission, German hospitalization incidences are particularly affected by delays and can take several weeks or months to fully stabilize. For this study, all methods were applied from 22 November 2021 to 29 April 2022, with probabilistic nowcasts produced each day for the current and 28 preceding days. Nowcasts at the national, state, and age-group levels were collected in the form of quantiles in a public repository and displayed in a dashboard. Moreover, a mean and a median ensemble nowcast were generated. We find that overall, the compared methods were able to remove a large part of the biases introduced by delays. Most participating teams underestimated the importance of very long delays, though, resulting in nowcasts with a slight downward bias. The accompanying prediction intervals were also too narrow for almost all methods. Averaged over all nowcast horizons, the best performance was achieved by a model using case incidences as a covariate and taking into account longer delays than the other approaches. For the most recent days, which are often considered the most relevant in practice, a mean ensemble of the submitted nowcasts performed best. We conclude by providing some lessons learned on the definition of nowcasting targets and practical challenges.},

  abstract = {Deep learning for time series forecasting has traditionally operated within a one-model-per-dataset framework, limiting its potential to leverage the game-changing impact of large pre-trained models. The concept of universal forecasting, emerging from pre-training on a vast collection of time series datasets, envisions a single Large Time Series Model capable of addressing diverse downstream forecasting tasks. However, constructing such a model poses unique challenges specific to time series data: i) cross-frequency learning, ii) accommodating an arbitrary number of variates for multivariate time series, and iii) addressing the varying distributional properties inherent in large-scale data. To address these challenges, we present novel enhancements to the conventional time series Transformer architecture, resulting in our proposed Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer (Moirai). Trained on our newly introduced Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA) featuring over 27B observations across nine domains, Moirai achieves competitive or superior performance as a zero-shot forecaster when compared to full-shot models.

However, generating calibrated and sharp probabilistic forecasts is challenging. In this article, a post-processing approach, Mixture Probabilistic Model (MPM), is proposed to calibrate probabilistic ensemble forecasts subject to sharpness. In particular, the proposed MPM is applied to precipitation forecasting. First, the Censored and Shifted Gamma (CSG0) distribution is considered as the probability density function (PDF) for precipitation. Then, the predictive PDF of MPM is mixed by the individual PDFs which are fitted from raw ensemble members. Finally, to estimate optimal weight parameters for the mixture of individual PDFs, the Dirichlet distribution is utilized and the skills of the mixture model and individuals are both taken into consideration. The proposed MPM was tested using Innsbruck ensemble precipitation data and 6 h accumulated precipitation ensemble forecast data in east China from August to November 2017. Compared with raw forecasts and three state-of-the-art post-processing approaches, MPM showed improved performance for all verification scores. The quantitative and qualitative analyses of results in both cases indicate the potential and effectiveness of MPM for precipitation ensemble forecasting.},

A good open-source implementation of copulas is much needed for more practitioners to enjoy the joy of copulas. This article presents the design, features, and some implementation details of the R package copula. The package provides a carefully designed and easily extensible platform for multivariate modeling with copulas in R. S4 classes for most frequently used elliptical copulas and Archimedean copulas are implemented, with methods for density/distribution evaluation, random number generation, and graphical display. Fitting copula-based models with maximum likelihood method is provided as template examples. With the classes and methods in the package, the package can be easily extended by user-defined copulas and margins to solve problems.},

Probabilistic copula calibration is a nat- ural analogue of probabilistic calibration in the univariate setting. It can be assessed empirically by checking for the uniformity of the copula prob- ability integral transform (CopPIT), which is invariant under coordinate permutations and coordinatewise strictly monotone transformations of the predictive distribution and the outcome. The CopPIT histogram can be interpreted as a generalization and variant of the multivariate rank his- togram, which has been used to check the calibration of ensemble forecasts. Kendall calibration is an analogue of marginal calibration in the univariate case. Methods and tools are illustrated in simulation studies and applied to compare raw numerical model and statistically postprocessed ensemble forecasts of bivariate wind vectors.},

We provide evidence that despite a minor edge in predictive performance overall, the multivariate modeling framework does not uniformly outperform the univariate one across all 12 considered datasets, seasons of the year or hours of the day, and at times is outperformed by the latter. This is an indication that combining advanced structures or the corresponding forecasts from both modeling approaches can bring a further improvement in forecasting accuracy. We show that this indeed can be the case, even for a simple averaging scheme involving only two models. Finally, we also analyze variable selection for the best performing high-dimensional lasso-type models, thus provide guidelines to structuring better performing forecasting model designs.},
