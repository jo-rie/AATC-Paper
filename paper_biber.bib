  ABSTRACT = {Digital remotely sensed observations of the atmosphere, particularly from radars and satellites, have become increasingly available over the last 15 years. Together with developments in computer technology this has stimulated the design and operation of a variety of systems to exploit these data in weather forecasting. Growing awareness of the importance of detailed site specific weather information and forecasts from zero to a few hours ahead has led to the emergence of a particular kind of forecasting called nowcasting which depends on the exceptionally detailed knowledge of the current pattern of weather that remote sensing can provide. This type of weather forecasting is reviewed, with emphasis on the measurement and extrapolation up to about 2 hours ahead of fields of various weather parameters, especially rainfall. Trends in the design of nowcasting systems are discussed, and potential benefits summarized.},

  ABSTRACT = {Introduction. Bias and precision statistics have succeeded regression analysis when measurement techniques are compared. However, when applied to cardiac output measurements, inconsistencies occur in reporting the results of this form of analysis. Methods. A MEDLINE search was performed, dating from 1986. Studies comparing techniques of cardiac output measurement using bias and precision statistics were surveyed. An error-gram was constructed from the percentage errors in the test and reference methods and was used to determine acceptable limits of agreement between methods. Results. Twenty-five articles were found. Presentation of statistical data varied greatly. Four different statistical parameters were used to describe the agreement between measurements. The overall limits of agreement in studies evaluating bioimpedance (n = 23) was ±37\% (15–82\%) and in those evaluating Doppler ultrasound (n = 11) ±65\% (25–225\%). Objective criteria used to assess outcome were given in only 44\% of the articles. These were (i) limits of agreement approaching ±15–20\%, (ii) limits of agreement of less than 1 L/min, and (iii) more than 75\% of bias measurements within ±20\% of the mean. Graphically, we showed that limits of agreement of up to ±30\% were acceptable. Conclusions. When using bias and precision statistics, cardiac output, bias, limits of agreement, and percentage error should be presented. Using current reference methods, acceptance of a new technique should rely on limits of agreement of up to ±30\%.},

  ABSTRACT = {Probabilistic forecasts of continuous variables take the form of predictive densities or predictive cumulative distribution functions. We propose a diagnostic approach to the evaluation of predictive performance that is based on the paradigm of maximizing the sharpness of the predictive distributions subject to calibration. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the distributional forecasts and the observations and is a joint property of the predictions and the events that materialize. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and is a property of the forecasts only. A simple theoretical framework allows us to distinguish between probabilistic calibration, exceedance calibration and marginal calibration. We propose and study tools for checking calibration and sharpness, among them the probability integral transform histogram, marginal calibration plots, the sharpness diagram and proper scoring rules. The diagnostic approach is illustrated by an assessment and ranking of probabilistic forecasts of wind speed at the Stateline wind energy centre in the US Pacific Northwest. In combination with cross-validation or in the time series context, our proposal provides very general, nonparametric alternatives to the use of information criteria for model diagnostics and model selection. © 2007 Royal Statistical Society.},

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract To assess the current dynamics of an epidemic, it is central to collect information on the daily number of newly diseased cases. This is especially important in real‐time surveillance, where the aim is to gain situational awareness, for example, if cases are currently increasing or decreasing. Reporting delays between disease onset and case reporting hamper our ability to understand the dynamics of an epidemic close to now when looking at the number of daily reported cases only. Nowcasting can be used to adjust daily case counts for occurred‐but‐not‐yet‐reported events. Here, we present a novel application of nowcasting to data on the current COVID‐19 pandemic in Bavaria. It is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model that considers changes in the reporting delay distribution over time and associated with the weekday of reporting. Furthermore, we present a way to estimate the effective time‐varying case reproduction number based on predictions of the nowcast. The approaches are based on previously published work, that we considerably extended and adapted to the current task of nowcasting COVID‐19 cases. We provide methodological details of the developed approach, illustrate results based on data of the current pandemic, and evaluate the model based on synthetic and retrospective data on COVID‐19 in Bavaria. Results of our nowcasting are reported to the Bavarian health authority and published on a webpage on a daily basis ( https://corona.stat.uni-muenchen.de/ ). Code and synthetic data for the analysis are available from https://github.com/FelixGuenther/nc\_covid19\_bavaria and can be used for adaption of our approach to different~data.},

  ABSTRACT = {Summary The bootstrap is a method for estimating the distribution of an estimator or test statistic by resampling one's data or a model estimated from the data. The methods that are available for implementing the bootstrap and the accuracy of bootstrap estimates depend on whether the data are an independent random sample or a time series. This paper is concerned with the application of the bootstrap to time‐series data when one does not have a finite‐dimensional parametric model that reduces the data generation process to independent random sampling. We review the methods that have been proposed for implementing the bootstrap in this situation and discuss the accuracy of these methods relative to that of first‐order asymptotic approximations. We argue that methods for implementing the bootstrap with time‐series data are not as well understood as methods for data that are independent random samples. Although promising bootstrap methods for time series are available, there is a considerable need for further research in the application of the bootstrap to time series. We describe some of the important unsolved problems. Résumé Le bootstrap est une méthode pour estimer la distribution d'un estimateur en rééchantillonnant ses données ou un modéle estiméà partir des données. Les méthodes disponibles pour mettre en oeuvre le bootstrap et la précision des estimateurs de bootstrap dépendent de ce que les données proviennent d'un échantillon aléatoire indépendant ou d'une série temporelle. Cet article concerne l'application du bootstrap aux données des séries temporelles quand on ne dispose pas de modéle paramétrique de dimension finie qui réduise le processus de génération des données à l'échantillonnage aléatoire indépendent. Nous examinons les méthodes qui ont été proposées pour mettre en oeuvre le bootstrap dans cette situation et discutons la precision de ces méthodes comparativement à celle des approximations asymptotiques de premier ordre. Nous montrons que les méthodes pour mettre en oeuvre le bootstrap avec les données des séries temporelles ne sont pas aussi bien comprises que les méthodes pour les données des échantillons aléatoires indépendants. Bien que des méthodes de bootstrap prometteuses pour les séries temporelles soient disponibles, il y a un besoin considérable de recherche supplémental re dans leur application.

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract This article provides an introduction to the bootstrap. The bootstrap provides statistical inferences—standard error and bias estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests—without assumptions such as Normal distributions or equal variances. As such, bootstrap methods can be remarkably more accurate than classical inferences based on Normal or t distributions. The bootstrap uses the same basic procedure regardless of the statistic being calculated, without requiring the use of application‐specific formulae. This article may provide two big surprises for many readers. The first is that the bootstrap shows that common t confidence intervals are woefully inaccurate when populations are skewed, with one‐sided coverage levels off by factors of two or more, even for very large samples. The second is that the number of bootstrap samples required is much larger than generally realized.

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract Background To assure the equivalence between new clinical measurement methods and the standard methods, the four-quadrant plot and the plot’s concordance rate is used in clinical practice, along with Bland-Altman analysis. The conventional concordance rate does not consider the correlation among the data on individual subjects, which may affect its proper evaluation. Methods We propose a new concordance rate for the four-quadrant plot based on multivariate normal distribution to take into account the covariance within each individual subject. The proposed concordance rate is formulated as the conditional probability of the agreement. It contains a parameter to set the minimum concordant number between two measurement methods, which is regarded as agreement. This parameter allows flexibility in the interpretation of the results. Results Through numerical simulations, the AUC value of the proposed method was 0.967, while that of the conventional concordance rate was 0.938. In the application to a real example, the AUC value of the proposed method was 0.999 and that of the conventional concordance rate was 0.964. Conclusion From the results of numerical simulations and a real example, the proposed concordance rate showed better accuracy and higher diagnosability than the conventional approaches.},

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract Background:\enspace{} Shifts in the supply of and demand for emergency department (ED) resources make the efficient allocation of ED resources increasingly important. Forecasting is a vital activity that guides decision‐making in many areas of economic, industrial, and scientific planning, but has gained little traction in the health care industry. There are few studies that explore the use of forecasting methods to predict patient volumes in the ED. Objectives:\enspace{} The goals of this study are to explore and evaluate the use of several statistical forecasting methods to predict daily ED patient volumes at three diverse hospital EDs and to compare the accuracy of these methods to the accuracy of a previously proposed forecasting method. Methods:\enspace{} Daily patient arrivals at three hospital EDs were collected for the period January 1, 2005, through March 31, 2007. The authors evaluated the use of seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, time series regression, exponential smoothing, and artificial neural network models to forecast daily patient volumes at each facility. Forecasts were made for horizons ranging from 1 to 30{$\quad$}days in advance. The forecast accuracy achieved by the various forecasting methods was compared to the forecast accuracy achieved when using a benchmark forecasting method already available in the emergency medicine literature. Results:\enspace{} All time series methods considered in this analysis provided improved in‐sample model goodness of fit. However, postsample analysis revealed that time series regression models that augment linear regression models by accounting for serial autocorrelation offered only small improvements in terms of postsample forecast accuracy, relative to multiple linear regression models, while seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, exponential smoothing, and artificial neural network forecasting models did not provide consistently accurate forecasts of daily ED volumes. Conclusions:\enspace{} This study confirms the widely held belief that daily demand for ED services is characterized by seasonal and weekly patterns. The authors compared several time series forecasting methods to a benchmark multiple linear regression model. The results suggest that the existing methodology proposed in the literature, multiple linear regression based on calendar variables, is a reasonable approach to forecasting daily patient volumes in the ED. However, the authors conclude that regression‐based models that incorporate calendar variables, account for site‐specific special‐day effects, and allow for residual autocorrelation provide a more appropriate, informative, and consistently accurate approach to forecasting daily ED patient volumes.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper reviews current density forecast evaluation procedures, and considers a proposal that such procedures be augmented by an assessment of 'sharpness'. This was motivated by an example in which some standard evaluation procedures using probability integral transforms cannot distinguish the ideal forecast from several competing forecasts. We show that this example has some unrealistic features from a time series forecasting perspective, and so provides insecure foundations for the argument that existing calibration procedures are inadequate in practice. Our alternative, more realistic example shows how relevant statistical methods, including information-based methods, provide the required discrimination between competing forecasts. We introduce a new test of density forecast efficiency. © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Almost all record sets include a waveform record containing digitized signals (typically including ECG, ABP, respiration, and PPG, and frequently other signals) and a "numerics" record containing time series of periodic measurements, each presenting a quasi-continuous recording of vital signs of a single patient throughout an ICU stay (typically a few days, but many are several weeks in duration).

  ABSTRACT = {Background Limitations in the imaging views that can be obtained with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) have hindered development of a widely adopted Doppler method for cardiac output (CO) monitoring. The authors evaluated a CO technique that combines steerable continuous-wave Doppler with the imaging capabilities of two-dimensional multiplane TEE. Methods From the transverse plane transgastric, short-axis view of the left ventricle, the imaging array was rotated to view the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and ascending aorta. Steerable continuous-wave Doppler was subsequently used to measure aortic blood flow velocities. Aortic valve area was determined using a triangular orifice model. Matched thermodilution and Doppler CO measurements were obtained serially during surgery. Results The left ventricular outflow tract was imaged in 32 of 33 patients (97\%). Data analysis reveal a mean difference between techniques of -0.01 l/min, and a standard deviation of the differences of 0.56 l/min. Multiple regression showed a correlation of r = 0.98 between intrasubject changes in CO. Multiplane TEE correctly tracked the direction of 37 of 38 serial changes in thermodilution CO but with a modest 14\% underestimation of the magnitude of these changes. Conclusions These results indicate that multiplane TEE can provide an alternative method for the intraoperative measurement of CO. The ability of the rotatable imaging array to align with the left ventricular outflow tract and the need for only minimal adjustments in probe position advance the utility of intraoperative TEE.},

  ABSTRACT = {Linear pooling is by far the most popular method for combining probability forecasts. However, any non-trivial weighted average of two or more distinct, calibrated probability forecasts is necessarily uncalibrated and lacks sharpness. In view of this, linear pooling requires recalibration, even in the ideal case in which the individual forecasts are calibrated. Towards this end, we propose a beta-transformed linear opinion pool for the aggregation of probability forecasts from distinct, calibrated or uncalibrated sources. The method fits an optimal non-linearly recalibrated forecast combination, by compositing a beta transform and the traditional linear opinion pool. The technique is illustrated in a simulation example and in a case-study on statistical and National Weather Service probability of precipitation forecasts. © 2010 Royal Statistical Society.},

  ABSTRACT = {The measurement of arterial pressure (AP) is a key component of hemodynamic monitoring. A variety of different innovative AP monitoring technologies became recently available. The decision to use these technologies must be based on their measurement performance in validation studies. These studies are AP method comparison studies comparing a new method (“test method”) with a reference method. In these studies, different comparative statistical tests are used including correlation analysis, Bland-Altman analysis, and trending analysis. These tests provide information about the statistical agreement without adequately providing information about the clinical relevance of differences between the measurement methods. To overcome this problem, we, in this study, propose an “error grid analysis” for AP method comparison studies that allows illustrating the clinical relevance of measurement differences. We constructed smoothed consensus error grids with calibrated risk zones derived from a survey among 25 specialists in anesthesiology and intensive care medicine. Differences between measurements of the test and the reference method are classified into 5 risk levels ranging from “no risk” to “dangerous risk”; the classification depends on both the differences between the measurements and on the measurements themselves. Based on worked examples and data from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database, we show that the proposed error grids give information about the clinical relevance of AP measurement differences that cannot be obtained from Bland-Altman analysis. Our approach also offers a framework on how to adapt the error grid analysis for different clinical settings and patient populations.},

The correct use of metrological terms is also of crucial importance in validation studies. The European Union published a new directive on medical devices, mentioning that in the case of devices with a measuring function, the notified body is involved in all aspects relating to the conformity of the device with the metrological requirements. It is therefore the task of the scientific societies to establish the standards in their area of expertise. Adopting the same understandings and definitions among clinicians and scientists is obviously the first step. In this metrologic review (part 1), we list and explain the most important terms defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures regarding quantities and units, properties of measurements, devices for measurement, properties of measuring devices, and measurement standards, with specific examples from perioperative and intensive care medicine.},

@ARTICLE{Wolffram2023,
  ABSTRACT = {Real-time surveillance is a crucial element in the response to infectious disease outbreaks. However, the interpretation of incidence data is often hampered by delays occurring at various stages of data gathering and reporting. As a result, recent values are biased downward, which obscures current trends. Statistical nowcasting techniques can be employed to correct these biases, allowing for accurate characterization of recent developments and thus enhancing situational awareness. In this paper, we present a preregistered real-time assessment of eight nowcasting approaches, applied by independent research teams to German 7-day hospitalization incidences during the COVID-19 pandemic. This indicator played an important role in the management of the outbreak in Germany and was linked to levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions via certain thresholds. Due to its definition, in which hospitalization counts are aggregated by the date of case report rather than admission, German hospitalization incidences are particularly affected by delays and can take several weeks or months to fully stabilize. For this study, all methods were applied from 22 November 2021 to 29 April 2022, with probabilistic nowcasts produced each day for the current and 28 preceding days. Nowcasts at the national, state, and age-group levels were collected in the form of quantiles in a public repository and displayed in a dashboard. Moreover, a mean and a median ensemble nowcast were generated. We find that overall, the compared methods were able to remove a large part of the biases introduced by delays. Most participating teams underestimated the importance of very long delays, though, resulting in nowcasts with a slight downward bias. The accompanying prediction intervals were also too narrow for almost all methods. Averaged over all nowcast horizons, the best performance was achieved by a model using case incidences as a covariate and taking into account longer delays than the other approaches. For the most recent days, which are often considered the most relevant in practice, a mean ensemble of the submitted nowcasts performed best. We conclude by providing some lessons learned on the definition of nowcasting targets and practical challenges.},
