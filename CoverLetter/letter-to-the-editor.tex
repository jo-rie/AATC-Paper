\opening{Dear Dr. Lo Monaco,}

We hereby submit our manuscript

\begin{quote}
\textit{On the assessment of the ability of measurements, nowcasts, and forecasts to track changes}
\end{quote}

by Bolin Liu, Bernd Saugel, Oliver Grothe, and myself for your kind consideration for publication in BMC Medical Research Methodology.

The manuscript introduces novel statistical methods and visualization techniques for assessing the ability of medical measurements, nowcasts, and forecasts to predict the correct direction of change.
These methods are exemplified using three distinct medical and healthcare datasets.
Hence, the manuscript aligns directly with the scope of BMC Medical Research Methodology.

We declare that there are no potential competing interests related to this research or manuscript.
All authors have reviewed and approved this manuscript for submission.
We confirm that the content of this manuscript has not been published, nor has it been submitted for publication in another journal.
This work is original and has not been considered by any other journal.
Please note that the material is also part of my doctoral thesis.

We respectfully suggest Prof. Dr. Alexander Hapfelmeier (\url{alexander.hapfelmeier@mri.tum.de}) from the Institute of AI and Informatics in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich, and Dr. Simon Vistisen (\url{vistisen@clin.au.dk}), Associate Professor and Business Engagement Partner in the Department of Clinical Medicine at Aarhus University and the Department of Anaesthesia \& Intensive Care at Aarhus University Hospital, as potential reviewers for our manuscript.

We are confident this paper represents a valuable and novel contribution to the evaluation of forecasting, nowcasting, and measurement methods in healthcare research.
